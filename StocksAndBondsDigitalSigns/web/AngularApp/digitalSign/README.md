# Serverless deployment (Ask Jordan if you want a deployment done)

This article serves as a reference to these instructions (https://medium.com/@maciejtreder/angular-serverless-a713e86ea07a)



`ng add @ng-toolkit/serverless â€”-provider aws` Gets the scripts for deploying to aws using serverless.io.

`npm run build:serverless:deploy` Builds the deployment package and deploys it (This uses cloudformation, so reference that to see what was actually created)

Next add the Twitter endpoint to the API Gateway and update the .env credentials for it
