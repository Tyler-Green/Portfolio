in one of my mani video i have attain from the local librari , casablanca wa my third classic in some week . 
the other be citizen kane and vertigo ( ye , i am tri to see as mani of afi 's greatest movi ever made as i can ) . 
but , casablanca stood out from the rest for me : it wa actual watchabl . 
what most hail as the greatest american film ever , casablanca is n't so much a love stori as a polit frenzi with a love triangl thrown in . 
it seem that star humphri bogart spend about 85 percent of the movi with variou leader of the nation instead of with ingr bergman . 
that annoy me , as did the end . 
whi did n't the plan turn around ? ! ? 
surprisingli , i enjoy the film . 
i like bogart 's charact and hi act ( not over the top as most actor in hi era ) . 
i onc read about if you had a choic to be in a movi , which one would it be , and a women said casablanca . 
at first i wa think to myself `` whi ? `` 
then , as i watch the film again , i understood whi . 
the movi is veri well done and the script top-notch , although i doubt i understood more than half of the polit mumbo jumbo . 
casablanca is , in my mind , no classic ( like solari ) , but it is a good film and stylishli shot . 
hey , hollywood , how about thi : a remak with harrison ford and ann hech ? 
now that would be a classic .
