a costum drama set in the 1500 , england , elizabeth is a lush , romant , polit masterpiec about the upset over the cross of a protest queen from a respect cathol one . 
when the court and countri are a whole after the pass of the queen , the royal famili , so to speak , are upset that a protest should be crowen , and not anoth cathol , plu , the new queen , elizabeth i ( cate blanchett ) , wa the bastard babi of the previou queen mari 's father . 
the persecut over cathol and protest is n't the onli major in elizabeth . 
elizabeth i must face the decis to give up person pleasur , and her lover ( joseph fienn of shakespear in love ) , in order to rule , success , the countri , which she did for 40 more year . 
both elizabeth and shakespear in love are set in the elizabethian era , and both featur a queen elizabeth i ( judi dench play her in love ) , or cours . 
yet , i found elizabeth more stimul and involv than love , not just becaus elizabeth featur a great deal more of elizabeth i , but becaus i found blanchett a more power , hypnot sens for the role . 
elizabeth , also featur geoffrey rush and richard attenborough , is my pick for the best pictur of 1998 award . 
it 's a dynam , import , breathtak film of loyalti , power , greed , and trust . 
shakespear would die for the book right .
