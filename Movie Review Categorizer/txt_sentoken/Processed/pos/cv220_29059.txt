a strang mixtur of _shine_ , _basquiat_ , _angel heart_ , and grant morrison & dave mckean 's graphic novel `` arkham asylum `` , _the caveman 's valentine_ is a feverish tale of a homeless madman-cum-detect who , on the morn of februari 14th , discov a `` valentin `` just outsid hi new york cave : one of ella fitzgerald 's strang fruit , stuck in the crotch of a tree -- a young male model murder and frozen to a branch . 
believ at first that hi imagin nemesi stuyves , shoot evil ray into hi mind from atop the chrysler build , is respons for the murder , romulu ( samuel l . jackson ) is put on the trail of an avant-gard photograph in the mapplethorp mould , david leppenraub ( colm feor ) . 
hi minor sleuth interrupt by the occasion delusion fit and bout with an ecstasi of creation ( romulu wa a brilliant julliard-train pianist prior to hi psychosi ) , romulu uncov clue and harass suspect on hi way to convinc hi police-woman daughter ( aunjanu elli ) that even though he 's a nut , that doe n't mean that he ca n't solv a high-profil societi murder . 
everi moment an exhaust workshop of idea , and everi charact the same , _the caveman 's valentine_ is a concept so `` high concept `` that it suddenli becam clear to me that the film fit into the comic book genr of entertain , with romulu 's `` caveman `` a slightli more mundan version of todd mcfarlan 's urban noir hero , spawn . 
with a long-vanish wife ( tamara tuni ) act as a spiritu guid , the occasion social cast commentari , the secret base in a cave , a diverg geniu person with a network of inform and support , and a wickedli colour arch-enemi , the film pile on the lurid comic book detail and dizzi slapdash colour to such a lavish extent that i wa vagu surpris that the blue polic car were n't inscrib with `` gotham pd . `` 
that be said , _the caveman 's valentine_ can onli realli succeed as a heroic fantasi , a frank miller graphic novel that ha the audac to portray the blood stain a field of virgin snow expand to form the shape of a heart . 
the difficulti with the film spring from the misunderstand that it somehow adher to the convent of a thriller or a polic procedur when , in fact , _the caveman 's valentine_ is a superhero fabl that take on the caus of the homeless ( again like mcfarlan 's spawn ) while attack the entrench rule class in govern and the art . 
it is no small detail that our hero , romulu , is not onli name for a member of the rule class who live hi life ( in legend ) without knowledg of hi royal birth , but also that our romulu ha turn hi back on the comfort of the literati in favour of a mystic exist live in a cave in a park . in the romulu mytholog , sign of romulu ' royal blood is brought by twelv vultur , while in the film , the call to action for our hero come in the form of not the carrion bird , but of the carrion itself . 
whether or not romulu of _the caveman 's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist georg daw green , upon whose novel hi own screenplay is base , a franchis , the fact remain that _the caveman 's valentine_ is easili the most misunderstood film of 2001 thu far . 
it , along with m . night shyamalan 's _unbreakable_ , is a matur cinemat extrapol of the graphic novel format which ha , sinc miller 's semin `` the dark knight return `` , redefin the comic medium as one suitabl for matur rumin on psycholog sticki topic . 
reader of sam keith 's brilliant `` the maxx `` comic seri ( or of mtv 's short-liv anim adapt of the same ) are alreadi familiar with the idea of a homeless man place in the posit of knight errant and king of hi own twist demesn . 
the failur of both `` the maxx `` tv show and of _the caveman 's valentine_ ( not forget the initi backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggest that the public may not be readi for america 's surpris contribut to dark fantasi . 
luxuriantli lit , brashli satur , and comic-panel frame with a virtuoso grace by cinematograph ami vincent ( _death in venic , ca_ ) , while inhabit robin standef 's ( _practic magic_ ) mesmer set , _the caveman 's valentine_ is an unremittingli gorgeou film . 
kasi lemmon , follow up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve 's bayou_ , which play on similar theme of manufactur realiti and mystic , fulfil much of her immens promis with a tale of seraph and lost boy , artist and suffer . 
_the caveman 's valentine_ is an eleg and piquant express of hope for justic in a tilt landscap . 
clearli not for everi tast , when approach with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stun and intens fascin film of the year : a redefinit of the hero archetyp for a post-modern audienc with urine-stain wool trench coat in place of blue tight and red cape . 
_the caveman 's valentine_ is a fine and a courag film , crazi enough to suggest that the deliri yammer of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chao of eliot 's rat 's alley wasteland .
