well , i 'll admit when i first heard about thi film ( which wa befor dant 's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister ' had start . 
so now it seem that we 're in a full fledg return to the '70 's disast film era . 
with 'twister ' , 'dant 's peak ' , 'volcano ' and soon 'flood ' and jame cameron 's extremli expens 'titan ' 
i 'll say first off i enjoy 'volcano ' much more than i did 'dant peak ' . 
part of that is just be bias as i usual enjoy anyth that tommi lee jone appear in . 
i 've been read a lot about the movi be 'cheezi ' or 'hokey ' and realli did n't see or think that onc dure the entir film . 
i get bore easili and thi film did n't bore me for a minut . 
anoth thing , and boy am i bitch today ! , that bother me is when critic and such go on about `` well that not realli possibl . `` 
you know what ? 
i could n't give a bloodi damn if it 's possibl or not , realli i could n't . 
it 's a freak movi and i do n't want realiti thrown in my face . 
i want to be abl to see the imposs , the all might `` what if `` to mani review have seen one to mani movi ! 
the special effect are the second star to thi featur . 
they are so amaz that i found it hard sometim to believ they were inde fx and la wa wa not burn to the ground . 
they did an incred job and come oscar time ( if they rememb ) some notic better be thrown there way .
