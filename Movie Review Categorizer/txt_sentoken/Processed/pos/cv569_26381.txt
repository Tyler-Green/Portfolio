after a rather disappoint `` mari railli `` , stephen frear is now offici back in busi with a comeback worthi of prais . 
thi is one of the best surpris of thi season -- a sweet , small budget comedi with a big heart . 
in fact it 's not even a comedi . 
it 's a drama or even more precis -- a clever satir on human relationship and need . 
base on a 1995 critic acclaim novel by british author nick hornbi , `` high fidel '' is a wri and likabl stori about a man 's quest for fulfil and happi . 
rob gordon wa a dj . 
it seem that he could make everyth spin -- except hi own life . 
now he own championship vinyl , a littl music store , somewher in new york . 
when he suddenli get dump by hi girlfriend , a gorgeou blond attorney , life suddenli loos everi purpos . 
decim , humili and on the verg of a mental ( and emot ) breakdown , he start medit over hi life and the way it could have been -- about what 's right and what 's import . 
he start `` categor `` life , divid it into `` top 5 list `` . 
and the most import is the `` top 5 list `` over the most pain breakup of hi life , start with 5th grade , when he found hi young girlfriend with anoth boy . 
though you might think that peopl chang , grow more matur with age , it just doe n't seem that way and all rob 's relationship were differ version of that first . 
where did he go wrong ? 
wa it he that screw up ? 
or mayb life just stink ? 
while he is lost in hi own self-piti , he must think of the `` top 5 list `` over hi need for the futur , find the right element and mix hi life togeth . 
with clever parallel to the cult of celebr , music and with incred direct narrat , it address the averag audienc member , in other word -- peopl like you and me . 
although a lot of thi honor should be address to the screenwrit ______ and frear , the director , the act is equal import as the written word . 
and here john cusack should absolut be mention . 
he is simpli superb . 
it is as much hi movi as it is frear ' . 
the film would not be the same without him . 
cusack -- whose charact is sadder , wiser and 35 -- bring intellig and warmth to post- mod ironi . 
most of hi dialogu is deliv directli to the camera -- not an easi task -- but cusack pull it off . 
hi interpret feel so emot right , so incred realist and precis that frear ' messag simpli ca n't be ignor or overseen . 
the other member of the cast do an equal remark job . 
both ______ and jack black are fabul . 
even catherin zeta jone appear in a role where she actual act , not just look beauti . 
howev , the most unexpect pleasant surpris is provid by todd louiso who deliv a spectacular comic perform as rob 's co-work and friend dick . 
thi is such an impress achiev that it 's almost worth a oscar-nomin . 
he is simpli a joy to behold . 
otherwis , everyon are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frear ' color blend . 
pretti much like edward norton 's `` keep the faith `` , thi film doe n't follow ani formula or belong to ani genr -- it 's dramat , tragic , sarcast , comic and even cynic , but never bitter or angri . 
it 's a littl bit of everyth , pretti much like life itself . 
noth seem unreal or stage . 
it reflect realiti as a mirror . 
as you watch it , you go through the same emot problem as the main charact . 
you feel and think and reflect . 
thi effect ha becom a rariti nowaday . 
although it 's primarili about the peril of love , `` high fidel '' is secondarili about pop music . 
rob own championship vinyl and hi employe , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbear barri ( jack black ) , are fellow music snob . 
music is the languag in their live , the measur by which they defin themselv and mark the signific event of their live . 
and so doe the movi . 
it is as much a music film as anyth els , as rob 's journey is wonder portray through care insert music fragment . 
in the end , you have gain someth while watch it . 
it 's not the film of the centuri or even of the year . 
it 's not an special effect extravaganza . 
it doe n't requir big explos or digit creatur to succeed . 
it 's a small movi about the big thing . 
and even though it doe not contain heavi philosophi , you feel as if you have experienc someth of signific , and you will experi that nice warm feel for quit some time .
