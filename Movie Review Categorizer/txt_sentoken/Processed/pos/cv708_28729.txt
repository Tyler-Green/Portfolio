onc upon a time a solitari ogr name shrek ( mike myer ) wa realli annoy to discov that hi swamp had been invad by three blind mice , seven dwarv and all the other fairi tale charact in the land , banish from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . 
unwittingli befriend by a non-stop talk donkey ( eddi murphi ) , shrek travel to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbl into a joust and come up the winner . 
hi prize ? 
to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surround by molten flame and protect by a dragon so she can becom farquaad 's bride . 
the ogr agre to the task in return for get hi solitari lifestyl back in `` shrek . `` 
it took four writer ( ted elliott and terri rossio ( `` the road to el dorado `` ) , roger s . h . 
schulman ( `` balto `` ) and joe stillman ( `` beavi and butthead do america `` ) ) to adapt william steig 's children 's book . 
the bad news ? 
they 've generic an alreadi simpl plotlin while heavili under the influenc of william goldman 's `` the princess bride . `` 
the good news ? 
there 's so much wacki humor cull from both fairi tale and popular cultur that thi movi should keep you in stitch . 
we get our first inkl that we 're in for a real treat as one of farquaad 's men , intent on round up magic creatur offer 'five schill for the possess boy ! ' after observ dreamwork ' rendit of disney 's anim pinocchio . 
meanwhil within the castl wall , a gingerbread man be tortur 
by farquaad spit ice and yell 'eat me ! ' 
befor break down and solemnli ask 'do you know the muffin man ? ' 
shrek , a green giant with bobbl antennae-lik ear , is a grumpi reclus who realli yearn to fit in ( although who could put up with hi habit of make candl from hi own ear wax ? ) . 
donkey is a hyperact , endearingli stunt creatur who can talk and , therefor , believ will make a great misfit pair with the uncoop shrek . 
donkey prove hi worth sweet talk the princess-guard dragon . 
the princess prove to be more than a shade offbeat after learn she 's not get the fairi tale issu rescu she 's been expect . 
when fiona 's true color are expos ( includ opportuni for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develop between her and shrek . 
the script 's detail are gleefulli impish , constantli poke fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad 's dulloc with it turnstyl entranc and 'it 's a small world ' parodi of an inform booth to the blue bird which meet a most un-disneyish fate after duet with fiona 'snow white ' style . 
popular cultur is repres with film refer to `` babe `` and `` charli ' angel `` via `` the matrix . `` 
myer choos hi 'so i marri an axe murder ' scottish brogu for shrek in order to give hi voic some heft . 
while thi may prove distract for anyon familiar with that film , overal it work more than not . 
eddi murphi steal the show as the fast-talk , motown-sing donkey , prove onc again hi talent as a vocal perform ( is it anoth wink at disney that donkey is pair with a dragon , a creatur murphi portray in disney 's 'mulan ? ' ) . 
lithgow 's a good choic for the supercili , height-challeng villain lord farquaad . 
diaz is energet but ultim nondescript voic princess fiona . 
( a better choic would have been minni driver , who 's proven herself a terrif vocal talent in such divers anim as disney 's `` tarzan , `` `` princess mononok `` and the `` south park `` movi . ) 
the comput anim look terrif ( particularli donkey ) , although it wo n't elicit the type of ooh and aah of pixar 's work ( `` toy stori , `` `` a bug 's life , `` `` toy stori 2 `` ) . 
in keep with it hip style , pop music is use , which like myer 's voic may be initi jar , but ultim satisfi ( while survey bridal candid via a 'date game ' parodi broadcast by snow white 's evil queen 's mirror , farquaad is told 'fiona like pina colada ' - cue jimmi buffet ! ) . 
`` shrek `` ha good lesson for kid and humor target at everi age group in the famili . 
while it may be deriv of the 1987 's `` the princess bride , `` `` shrek `` address a new gener with similar sensibl and doe n't suffer in the comparison .
