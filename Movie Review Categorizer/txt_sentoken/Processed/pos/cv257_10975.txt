that 's the question i ask myself when ventur nervous into `` the wed singer , `` the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnu . 
doe he draw laugh from hi sad , puppi dog express and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observ ? 
or do fan giggl when he scream at the top of hi lung at peopl ? 
or is it just the fact that he sing song with silli lyric that bowl audienc over ? 
well , there 's a littl bit of all of that in `` the wed singer `` and while i exit the theater still not one hundr percent sure of mr . sandler 's thing , i did have a surprisingli good time . 
that 's becaus , in a nutshel , `` the wed singer `` is one of the sweetest movi you 're ever like to come across . 
that 's right . 
sweet . 
the humor in the film run the gamut from dumb to mildli amus to laugh-out-loud hyster but the tone ? 
well , it 's just love . 
i have to admit i wa half-expect fart armpit humor , gratuit nuditi , superflu , cloy subplot , and some nasti , unnecessari violenc . 
instead ? 
well , i 've said it befor . 
sweet . 
the year is 1985 and sandler play robbi hart , the eponym wed singer , a job aspir rock star often settl for . 
when robbi 's fianc ? e dump him at hi own altar , robbi get depress and turn to a plucki waitress call julia ( drew barrymor ) who ha some problem of her own ( she 's marri a hunki junk bond dealer who , unbeknownst to her , is n't that big on monogami ) . 
it is n't give anyth away to say that robbi and julia fall in love . 
aww . . . 
sandler and barrymor are a good match and they 're assist by some terrif cameo appear , includ steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individu scene are perhap the funniest in the film . 
writer tim herlihi ( with uncredit assist from carri fisher ) keep the stori bubbl along to it predict conclus . 
it doe n't all work but it 's handl with such light-hearted that robbi and julia come togeth gener more smile than groan . 
herlihi and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreat the sight , sound , and affect of the 1980 . 
the soundtrack -- an ever-pres forc in the film -- is pack with wall-to-wal hit of the period , new wave upon new wave of song from billi idol 's `` white wed `` to the smith ' `` how soon is now ? `` 
to cultur club 's `` do you realli want to hurt me ? `` 
the mix of music and fashion would make `` the wed singer `` a great doubl featur with `` boogi night . `` 
if you grew up listen to the cure and a flock of seagul and the psychedel fur , then `` the wed singer `` is bound to put a nostalg hop in your stride . 
if you 're a fan of the lovabl , laughabl adam sandler , well . . . 
let 's just say that `` the wed singer `` might well be the onli film in recent memori to make * me * want to rent `` happi gilmor . ``
