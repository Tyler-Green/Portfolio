your friend and neighbor is a rather bizarr film about 6 peopl , who hop in and out of bed with each other . 
written and direct by neil labut , who 's first film , `` in the compani of men `` wa simpli marvel , disappoint a bit here with thi one . 
the stori involv two coupl ( ben stiller & catherin keener and aaron eckhart & ami brenneman ) , an artist assist ( nastassja kinski ) , and an egotist women abus ( jason patric ) . 
the charact 's name are not appar and are not mention in the entir movi . 
each of the charact ha their own sexual style and they do n't seem to `` merg `` togeth well . 
so the group experi behind their respect partner back . 
there are some hyster scene , one involv jason patric , aaron eckhart , and ben stiller 's charact . 
they are all in a sauna , talk about their best `` lay `` , when jason patric 's charact make a surpris confess . 
the whole scene is hilari and except well written and act . 
the enjoy thi movi , although it seem a tad lengthi ( even though it onli run 99 min . ) . 
the film 's cast is except with oscar calib perform by catherin keener , aaron eckhart , and jason patric . 
i would not recommend thi film , to peopl who are offend by convers that are veri sexual explicit . 
it did seem to offend peopl , more than half of the peopl in the theater left dure the film . 
although your friend and neighbor doe n't have the power of labut 's earlier film it still manag to be somewhat entertain and funni , while maintain a melancholi philosophi on human relationship .
