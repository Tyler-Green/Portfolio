no , i did not read the novel by thoma hardi , `` jude the obscur , `` hi final novel ( final becaus thi film creat such an outrag that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagu with bad luck throughout hi entir life . 
but , after watch the movi , i can imagin how incred depress it is . 
`` jude `` is a satir film from start to finish about societi 's way of spit out and chew up those unwant in it system , but what 's remark is how timeless thi film is . 
the film take place in the late 19th centuri ( or earli 20th - wa n't realli sure ) , but it stori could even be retold today in modern form , although it 'd be kinda differ ( a given ) . 
it tell the stori of jude ( christoph eccleston - the psychot account from `` shallow grave `` ) - a simpl , dim-wit young man with big dream . 
in it bleak , forebod open , shot in graini black and white , he get a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , hi teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , look upon a citi in the distanc , he say all you have to do is work hard and you can have anyth in the world . 
after marri and divorc an immatur woman name arabella ( rachel griffith ) becaus they frolick in the hay ( liter ) but did not ultim share anyth in common , he move away to a town with a giant univers , with a chanc to learn more , and get ahead in life . 
take a weld job , he work hard while studi constantli for hi colleg bar , recit latin over and over again , and train himself . 
but when he send hi applic for the school in , he is bluntli told to just remain a worker . 
anoth reason for go to thi town wa becaus someon in hi famili live there : sue ( kate winslet ) , hi cousin and a veri intellig but kinda mischevi young woman who want to be a school teacher . 
she and jude click eventu and becom veri endear friend , so much that when she spend the night at hi flat after run from her apprentic teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumor that she and jude did some nasti busi ( nudg nudg ) . 
sever twist turn in the storylin , and eventu jude and sue do do some nasti busi ( an interest scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversi non-wedlock , as she eventu give birth to their babi , and jude inherit hi son from arabella , who turn up again after awhil . 
becaus they are n't marri , and becaus they 're cousin , they run into problem with everi place they go to , carri around two children everywher , and onli stay in lodg for a veri brief period of time , then move on . 
if you did n't think thi wa harsh enough , wait till you see what happen later on . . . 
the sad truth is that jude is one of the miser peopl who can never get ani luck in thi world . 
he will never gain ani true happi , and ani happi that happen to him will be fleet , and will probabl bring more horribl instanc to hi life . 
part of it is hi fault - he 's too optimist , and too gullibl . 
but societi ha a way of take these peopl , and hurt them until their death . 
the end of `` jude `` is bleak becaus it ha to be ( although i hear the end of the novel is even wors - guess i 'll have to read it now ) . 
`` jude `` offer a satir view on societi 's cruelti , but show no way of cure thi , and thank heaven it doe n't . 
there 's no way to relinquish the selfish of societi , and ani solut would be too small to cure such a mass problem . 
satir ha alway been one of the few way of chang certain peopl 's mind , and that 's what `` jude `` is . 
sure , it 's one hell of a downer , but it need to be . 
the film also posess two fantast perform from it two lead , and some good support work along with it . 
christoph eccleston ( slightli resembl richard edson with hi new look and dumb express ) play jude wonder , sometim bring a big dumb smile to hi face , and make him kind of child-lik at other time . 
kate winslet , in a pre- `` titan `` perform , is brilliant , nail everi psych of her charact , and creat someon who 's troubl but veri seduct with her person . 
kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you do n't believ me , see `` titan , `` branagh 's `` hamlet , `` `` sens and sensibl , `` and `` heavenli creatur , `` the latter one be my favorit perform of her ) . 
in the support role , liam cunningham is a wonder flaw teacher , expos all hi bad part , but ultim be a pretti good person ; and rachel griffith is wonder immatur as jude 's wife , whom he never divorc . 
`` jude `` move at a veri slow pace , and keep taunt it viewer with chanc of happi for it protagonist , which would drive some peopl nut . 
but those who appreci good social commentari with their film , no matter how slow or downright depress they are ( thi one is both ) will appreci `` jude , `` though i doubt anyon truli enjoy it .
