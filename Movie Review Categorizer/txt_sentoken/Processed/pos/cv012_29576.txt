synopsi : bobbi garfield ( yelchin ) live in a small town with hi mirthless widow mother ( hope davi ) . 
bobbi 's world revolv around hi friend , especi the sprite carol ( boorem ) . 
then one day , a new boarder arriv at bobbi 's hous . 
ted brautigan ( hopkin ) is an enigmat man to whom bobbi take an immedi like . 
as the bond between bobbi and ted deepen , bobbi becom privi to ted 's great secret , an event which will chang both of their live forev . 
review : a small but enchant movi , `` heart in atlanti `` easili recal anoth king-inspir coming-of-ag film , `` stand by me `` , both in term of it set and the sentiment it convey . 
`` heart `` is a tribut to the magic of childhood , to those summer when the day seem neverend , and noth mean more than your closest friend . 
unlik `` stand by me `` , there is a supernatur element to `` heart `` , but although it is key to the plot , it is not promin . 
like `` stand by me `` , thi is a mostli character-driven film , and as such it benefit greatli from superb cast . 
yelchin is veri good as bobbi , find a good mix of innoc and resign . 
more splendid still is boorem , whom i prais highli for her work in `` along came a spider `` and who is simpli radiant here as carol . 
and then there is hopkin , who despit play such a quiet , introspect charact as ted , nonetheless command our attent everi time he is onscreen . 
less success is davi , whose strident elizabeth come across as overli cartoonish . 
i also found it odd that bobbi and carol 's other friend , sulli ( whose death as an adult set up the movi 's flashback frame devic ) , is paid virtual no attent . 
but hick ' direct is love without be cloy , and despit the movi 's gener lack of incid , it never ceas to weav it spell over the audienc .
