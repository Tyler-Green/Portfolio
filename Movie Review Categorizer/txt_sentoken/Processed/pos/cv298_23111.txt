is it ani wonder that most sequel fail to live up to their predecessor ? 
thank , `` toy stori 2 `` is a wonder except . 
i ca n't rememb the last time i saw a sequel as consist fun and invent as thi one . 
it 's yet anoth sign that pixar , the acclaim anim studio behind `` toy stori `` and `` a bug 's life , `` is still at the top of it game . 
woodi and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit `` toy stori , `` and thing have chang a bit sinc the last one end .

as in the origin film , `` toy stori 2 `` contain first-rat anim , and pixar studio ha done a remark job improv on the impress work they did there . 
reportedli , the film wa origin slate for a direct-to-video releas , but after see the improv that had been made , disney rightli decid to releas it into theater . 
the film is well worth see on the big screen . 
the color are bright , the textur sharp , and even the human charact look more `` human . `` 
the anim is consist seamless , with the action fast and furiou and the facial express believ . 
there are so mani impress sequenc that i 'd find it imposs to list them here , but i wa particularli wow by a scene where buzz and hi cohort must get across a busi intersect to get to al ' s toy barn , the store own by woodi 's captor . 
pixar 's rendit of the famili dog is also nice done , with fur so realist you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . 
the voic work is also perfectli complementari , and as with the first movi , doe much to help further charact develop . 
tom hank and tim allen again disappear into their role as woodi and buzz , make you forget who is do the voic . 
it wa woodi and buzz up there , not tom and tim . 
all the cast member from the origin repris their role , and each is excel . 
sever new voic have been ad , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayn knight do fine work .

the new charact are also develop quit well , especi jess , who narrat a sarah mclachlan-aid flashback illustr how she wa love , then forgotten by her owner . 
it may be computer-anim , and it may have sappi music , but it 's downright touch . 
the script , despit have a stori and screenplay each credit to four differ writer , is endlessli clever and invent , especi consid that it 's a sequel . 
the reason `` toy stori 2 `` work where other movi sequel fail is that it refus to just capit on the origin 's success by re-do the same stori and use the same charact . 
not thi one . 
we get charact chang , new charact , and new issu brought up . 
`` toy stori 2 `` is also remark for the way in which it keep reinvent itself . 
there is alway anoth clever idea wait just around the corner here . 
the humor is sharp and witti , with someth to amus both kid and adult . 
there are funni asid to film such as `` star war `` and `` jurass park , `` among other , new take on classic toy like barbi and rock 'em sock 'em robot , and appear from other pixar effort `` a bug 's life `` and the 1997 short `` geri 's game . `` 
( geri himself make an appear as a toy repairman who fix woodi 's broken arm . ) 
the action is fast and furiou , and the chase ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elev , on a baggag carousel , and in an airplan ) keep get bigger and better .
