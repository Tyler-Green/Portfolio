what can you say about jacki chan that ha n't alreadi been said . 
sinc the releas of 'rumbl in the bronx `` back in 1996 ( the u . s . releas ) , jacki ha becom a fairli recogniz commod on america 's video shelv . 
have made over 80 film , jacki ha final succeed in bring hi style of action-comedi to the west . 
hi latest releas , `` shanghai noon `` , is a joy tribut / spoof of the classic western . 
and by ad jacki chan into the genr , the tag line for the film ( `` the western get a kick in the pant `` ) ring true . 
jacki star as chon wang , a lesser imperi guard in the forbidden citi of china . 
the royal princess pei pei ( luci liu ) is set to be marri to the obnoxi son of a nobleman from anoth prefectur . 
unwil to follow her father 's wish , princess pei pei with the assist of her english tutor , decid to escap to america . 
but thi is all a ploy devis by exil guard lo fong , which will lead to the princess ' kidnap and ransom . 
unabl to take ani legal action , the ransom demand are met and three of the forbidden citi 's bravest guard ( play by cui ya hi , rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are order to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson citi , nevada . 
chon wang plead with the imperi court and is given permiss to join the team , as he is look upon as a buffoon . 
on a train in the u . s . jacki meet up with bandit roy o'bannon ( owen wilson ) . 
he is much less of a bandit than he is a glori hog , look simpl for the notorieti and fame that be a bandit will bring him . 
with hi gang in tow , roy attempt to rob the train , when one of hi gang murder the chines interpret of the royal court , who also happen to be chon wang 's uncl . 
chon wang give chase , foil the attempt robberi , but also leav himself strand in the desert . 
as the disgrac guard wander through the desert , he again come upon roy , who ha been left for dead by hi former gang . 
buri up to hi neck in the desert , roy plead with chon to dig him out . 
chon demand to know where carson citi is . 
roy direct him , and chon leav . 
but not befor stick two chopstick into roy 's mouth and tell him to dig himself . 
chon soon find himself confront by angri crow warrior , a friendli sioux tribe , gunsling , a hors that think and behav like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merril ) , befor onc again run into roy . 
`` shanghai noon `` is just good fun . 
the chemistri between the cast is remark . 
the perform are all accept within the whimsic level of the film . 
jacki 's perform is as good as anyth he 's done befor . 
he 's not call on to do much act here , as the charact is not written with ani depth . 
but jacki 's natur charisma shine through , and hi comic time is so perfect , both physic and ( surpris ) verbal that onc again he command the screen whenev he is on . 
owen wilson , last seen in the embarrass remak of `` the haunt `` , give a good natur perform as roy o'bannon . 
hi innoc is refresh and fun . 
a bad guy that 's not realli bad . 
hi scene with jacki are some of the best bit of comic duel sinc martin and lewi . 
luci liu as princess pei pei is given littl to do in the script , but for a chang doe not play a nymphet or some other deviant . 
the charact is a nobl woman of statu and wealth , but find a greater caus as a result of her own imprison . 
the rest of the perform are all broadli drawn comic perform . 
noth here is realist , mind you . 
`` shanghai noon `` is first and foremost a light , jovial film . 
and the perform match that style with eas . 
the cinematographi by dan mindel is gorgeou . 
use calgari , alberta as the prime locat . 
mr . mindel is abl to creat a lush , romant western feel to the film . 
noth here realli look like nevada , but the locat are so beauti shot and stage , the film can be look upon as a love tribut to earlier film of the genr . 
and as such , the script by alfr gough and mile millar play fast and loos with histori , but with rever to past film . 
homag to such film as `` high noon `` ( obvious ) , `` red river `` and most notabl `` butch cassidi & the sundanc kid `` all bring a sens of nostalgia to the film . 
it is a comfort experi . 
at a time when the western is consid either old hat or irrelev , here is a film that embrac those old attitud and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manag to make them palat and refresh . 
here is a film that is not contemptu of the genr . 
thi is the purest `` hors opera `` sinc the day of georg o'brian or john wayn . 
director tom dey ha craft a love tribut to hollywood 's past . 
in thi , hi first film mr . dey show both a love of charact and of craftsmanship that is refresh to see . 
noth here realli stand out , or take one 's attent away from the stori or action . 
and that is as it should be , when jacki chan is your star . 
and what of the action and stunt . 
well , while not up to a level of `` drunken master 2 `` or ani of jacki 's hong kong film , `` shanghai noon `` is mile ahead of anyth jacki ha done in an american film befor . 
hi time , choreographi , and creativ are still as sharp as ever . 
jacki even get to recreat a few scene from hi earlier film ( obviou to those of us that have seen those film , but refreshingli fun for those unfamiliar ) . 
final jacki can honestli say , that he ha made an u . s . , hi way and incorpor hi style . 
to sum up , `` shanghai noon `` is a fun summer confect . 
not too heavi and not too light . 
a fun and entertain film that the whole famili can enjoy ( parent be advis there are scene of smoke , drunken and peyot use ) . 
an enjoy and charm film that can and will be enjoy again and again .
