the central focu of michael winterbottom 's `` welcom to sarajevo `` is sarajevo itself , the citi under sieg , and it differ effect on the charact unfortun enough to be stuck there . 
it prove the backdrop for a stunningli realiz stori which refreshingli stray from mythic portent ( `` platoon `` ) , racial tumultuos ( the risibl `` the walk dead `` ) or a ting of schmaltzi ( `` schindler 's list `` ) . 
the two lead , stephen dillan as a report and emira nusev as an orphan with a plight few can identifi with , are extrem believ ; not one moment with them involv ring fals . 
the question is not what went right . 
the question is what went wrong . 
for one , the film fail to provid a polit overview of the war as it progress ( the dillan charact report an american plane depart from sarajevo as it depart , and that 's about it . ) . 
the assort of high-profil support actor , rang from woodi harrelson as a yanke report `` into `` liquor and cigarrett to marisa tomei as a huggabl children 's aid or somesuch are incap of rise abov the sketchi of their charact , albeit they strive . 
the interrupt use of authent war footag somewhat hamper the rest of the film , it make the fiction charact seem powerless by comparison . 
still , winterbottom eschew mawkish through flashi , frantic edit and imagin use of music . 
and it 's a plu , becaus he doe n't toy with our emot with sentiment bland . 
he want us to know that in war , no one is victori .

atom egoyan 's power medit `` the sweet hereaft `` is as anyth as haunt and transcendent as i 've seen thi year . 
it not onli explor the aftermath of a terribl tragedi with magnific subtleti , with cold , and stun shot of the backdrop of thi mistfortun but also by telegraph the sens of devast that ha permeat the small town with an enorm amount of digniti and respect for each and everi soul affect . 
ian holm as the somber , lone lawyer seek compens for the townspeopl , ha a decenc and a restraint uncommon with lawyer , he 's a lion for the wrong reason : the pain for have lost hi daughter ( she 's a druggi who frequent call him beg for money ) is reflect on the town . 
and in some mesmer flashback , we wit how she lost her puriti . 
it 's one of the most strikingli breathtak take on the loss of innoc i 've ever seen . 
but the most astound part goe to sarah polli , the peac , benevol girl who , in contrast to the other charact , remain the most mental stabl dure past , present or futur . 
her abil to convey conceal pain and uncondit love is the opposit , yet near-revolutionari role that won emili watson an oscar nomin for `` break the wave `` . 
both women are torn apart by an extraordinari incid but it is onli then that we truli see , truli feel , their wordless , omnipot love . 
`` the sweet hereaft `` though , is atom egoyan 's movi and as of now , he is emerg as the definit face of independ cinema . 
after surg to worldwid recognit with 1994 's `` exotica `` , `` the sweet hereaft `` make him someth few peopl in thi industri can call themselv : an artist . 
he interweav time with a delicaci and see a soul with a puriti that is just not common .
