while watch `` shallow grave , `` i found myself period notic themat similar to the coen ' `` blood simpl . `` 
both are good film in which sever charact , none of whom are the most conscienti to have walk the earth but still are not realli evil , indulg in an act of decept that soon necessit more seriou crime . 
the bodi count rise , and befor long seemingli normal peopl have blood on their hand . 
both film are also flaw , but for differ reason . 
`` blood simpl `` is unrelentingli dark and moodi , but it character were a littl hollow . 
`` shallow grave , `` on the other hand , is nearli flawless for an hour and twenti minut , and then the filmmak throw away much of what they 'd accomplish for a more standard , audience-pleas end . 
the event of the film were suffici intens and disturb that i honestli felt quit troubl by what i wa wit on screen most of the time , yet there wa a slight grin on my face at the end . 
as the film begin , we are introduc to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerri fox ) , and david ( christoph eccleston ) , a scottish trio live in an apart in glasgow . 
they are all sarcast and occasion obnoxi , but other than that they seem like a fairli normal bunch . 
a man name hugo move into the apart 's remain vacanc , and the next morn he is found dead of a drug overdos . 
juliet is about to call the polic when alex discov that hugo had brought with him a suitcas fill to the brim with cash ( presum from crimin activ ) . 
the three eventu decid to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a draw of straw , the particularli unenvi task of mutil the bodi so as to make it unidentifi and buri it fall to david , who had been the most reluct to partak in the scheme from the begin . 
all of thi transpir in the first twenti minut or so of the film , and part of what make `` shallow grave `` so brilliant for a while is that i honestli had no idea what wa come next . 
other than the obviou question of whi they do n't report the death and simpli hide the cash , which is not address , the plot and character , while sometim predict , work in a way that kept my attent and , on more than one occas , gave me chill . 
i will , therefor , attempt to continu thi review in a way that doe n't give away too much of the plot . 
broadli , the trio are in danger due to hugo 's underworld connect , as two goon search for the money and kill sever peopl in the process . 
a polic inspector ( ken stott ) is clearli suspici and visit the apart , ask point question and tri to unnerv the three suspect by exchang banal and weirdli humor bit of dialogu with a junior detect . 
david , meanwhil , becom increasingli paranoid , move into the attic , and develop an affin for sharp object . 
director danni boyl effect creat an atmospher of mount tension and suspicion in the apart , and final the three seem readi to turn against each other . 
while i do not consid myself the `` happi end are automat stupid `` type , i thought that `` shallow grave `` realli should have end in tragedi - a realist analysi of the stori up to the last ten minut of the film would indic that all three charact were probabl about to end up in prison , in the mental hospit , or in the morgu . 
thi could have been accomplish , quit credibl , but then boyl and screenwrit john hodg seem to flinch and opt for a more convent `` caper `` end in which we get a kick out of see who outsmart whom , and noth more . 
grant , thi is n't realli a `` happi `` end , but it 's still pretti light-heart compar to what preced it . 
i realli should n't say anyth more about the end as far as detail go , but let me add that it seem not onli shallow and lazi but also inconsist with the rest of the film and not veri believ . 
ye , thi end made me crack a smile for a coupl of minut , but ultim it left me feel as if i 'd been cheat . 
still , `` shallow grave `` wa brilliant most of the way through , and it doe at least meet the minimum requir for an entertain thriller , and i am therefor award it three star . 
i guess i just ca n't help but think about that fourth star that boyl and hodg let slip away .
