if chri farley had strap some fake mutton-chop sideburn to each side of hi head , spoken with a thick irish accent , and tri hi damnedest to play it straight , he would n't have been nearli as funni as brendan gleeson in `` i went down . `` 
gleeson , who 's not dissimilar to the late `` saturday night live `` alumnu in term of physic attribut , play a charact name bunni kelli in thi delight irish film . 
bunni is sent to counti cork to `` retriev `` one frank grogan for an irish gangster call tom french ( well dress like all good gangster should be and menacingli portray by toni doyl ) . 
bunni is to accompani git hyne ( peter mcdonald ) , recent releas from prison and oblig to tom for disfigur one of hi croni . 
that tom french is a mean bollock . 
he want frank back . 
and a small matter of some ? 25 , 000 that tom 's wife wa suppos to have given to frank . 
for thi he wo n't break anyon 's thumb . 
mayb . 
invent and engagingli written by conor mcpherson and direct by paddi breathnach , `` i went down `` follow the trial and tribul of git and bunni as they knock around peat bog , dimly-lit pub , and seedi hostelri tri to stay aliv and out of troubl . 
mcdonald is a newcom and a promis one at that , but gleeson ha been in over a dozen movi , most recent as father bubbl in anoth film with a veri irish accent on hilar , `` the butcher boy . `` 
even if you ca n't comprehend half of what they 're say , gleeson and mcdonald togeth make `` i went down `` a trip worth take . 
the film is in mani way reminisc of anoth `` littl `` independ featur , 1991 's `` highway 61 . `` 
that film , too , wa a road movi and it share the same kind of wri dialogu and humor situat as mcpherson 's tale : whimsic observ on life , carefully-craft vignett , deadpan convers asid , and scene that 'll make you laugh out loud . 
wit the episod in which our good-natur protagonist bind frank ( play by peter caffrey ) to a hotel bed , leav him with onli the tv remot for compani . 
that sequenc alon is on a par with satan lock himself out of hi car in `` highway 61 . `` 
what 's also charm about `` i went down `` is how the relationship between buddi and git develop . 
their trip becom an educ for both of them , but the way it 's handl is neither sappi nor labor . 
the onli thing in the film which approach clunki is the culmin explan , via flashback , of the relationship between frank and tom . 
it 's a littl too hollywood , and what make `` i went down `` so refresh is the fact that it rare pander to tradit convent of hollywood gangster movi . 
sure it 's gritti -- make that grubbi -- but it 's also pretti goofi . 
although `` i went down `` emphas the comed element of dis-organ crime , there are a coupl of fairli brutal scene in keep with the subject matter . 
do n't let these deter you , though ; `` i went down `` is a littl gem . 
it 's onli play at one philadelphia-area theater -- and i suspect it wo n't be there for long -- so catch it while you can .
