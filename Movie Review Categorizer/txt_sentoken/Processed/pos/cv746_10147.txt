( dimens film , `` scream 2 `` 's distributor , ha ask press to say extrem littl -- if anyth -- about the film 's twisti plot . 
that 's no easi task consid the wit that deserv to be mention here , but i will do my best to be vagu ( now , there 's a first ) . ) 
`` the first one wa [ good ] , but all the rest suck , `` said a cinematically-savvi teen in last winter 's we craven thriller `` scream , `` her statement refer to the film of the `` nightmar on elm street `` seri but realli put down franchis overkil in gener . 
the comment certainli carri clout : for everi truli great sequel , there appear to be a coupl of dud , make one wonder if writer are better off stick sole with fresh idea . 
but like it or not , along come `` scream 2 . `` and believ it or not , it 's a doozi -- a slick , sinist , madli subvers good time at the movi , as intent on send up hollywood 's sequel syndrom as much as it prequel poke fun at slasher convent . 
`` scream 2 `` is definit that rare movi thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side it origin with pride . 
it 's been two year sinc a pair of overzeal horror movi fan clad in edvard munch-esqu get-up carv their way through the young populac of woodsboro , california . 
those surviv the ordeal have gotten on with their live . 
plucki heroin sidney prescott ( neve campbel ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor colleg ; her pop culture-whiz pal randi meek ( jami kennedi ) ha tag along . 
trash tabloid report gale weather ( courteney cox ) ha written a best-sel base on their ordeal , the basi of which ha been turn into a ( veri bad ) movi call `` stab . `` 
and dewey riley ( david arquett ) , still suffer from wound inflict dure `` scream , `` ha left hi job as a polic offic for a while . 
life is tranquil . . . 
at least for a while . 
sever sudden murder bring sidney , randi , gale and dewey togeth again , but with suspici eye cast on each other and most of those in their surround -- if these four peopl learn anyth from the past , it 's to trust no one . 
thu , the possibl victim/potenti killer list includ said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerri o'connel ) , sidney 's new beau ; cici ( sara michel gellar ) , a chatti soror gal ; joel ( duan martin ) , gale 's cameraman who 's not too thrill with her blood-soak past ; halli ( elis neal ) , sidney 's sassi roommat ; debbi ( lauri metcalf ) , a local report who give gale some not-too-friendli competit ; and mickey ( timothi olyph ) , randi 's good friend and fellow film student . 
cotton weari ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongli accus of her mother 's murder in scream , also show up on campu -- but whi ? 
like the first scream , craven and screenwrit kevin williamson inaugur thing with a bang . 
thi time , it 's an extend sequenc that find an african-american coupl ( jada pinkett and omar epp ) attend a sneak preview of `` stab , `` make sli refer about everyth from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-rol of black in slasher cinema . 
befor tragedi ensu at the screen , the movie-within-a-movi setup allow for plenti of jokey moment , includ a scene from `` stab `` which turn scream 's now-fam drew barrymor prologu on it ear . 
( `` b -- -- , hang up the phone and star-69 hi a -- ! `` 
pinkett yell at the screen . ) 
it 's funni , creepi stuff ( i do n't think i 'll ever feel safe in a movi theater again ) that effect foreshadow the ratio of smart scare and spoofi laugh down the road . 
anoth flawless exampl of thi is a riotou cell phone-assault of the killer on randi , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it build comed and end with genuin terror becaus of the emot invest made on these delici charact . 
there are other superb set piec , but explain them risk ruin their effect . 
there are more player thi time around as to provid both a higher number suspect and a stagger bodi count . 
it 's someth of a trade-in -- the new charact are too larg in number to be as fully-develop as the origin `` scream `` gang , but thi movi pack in know perform ( especi by kennedi and cox ) and more death for your dollar . 
it can be argu that , while the origin might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier . 
it certainli doe n't skimp with shock -- a major one be the kill of one cast member veri near and dear to my heart ( i actual question craven and williamson 's judgment here , consid how much thi person ha ad to these film ) . 
sometim you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scene we 're shown are dead-on -- but for film fan , there are plenti of subtl nod to movi like `` the usual suspect , `` `` alien `` and `` the empir strike back . `` 
still , `` scream 2 `` doe so mani thing right , it 's petti to quibbl . 
it penchant for parodi is irresist , discuss of the merit of film sequel and all . 
the attract , solid cast is a definit bonu . 
and the denouement ( while not as shock as `` scream `` 's ) is priceless ; the film 's final revel incorpor bit of a particular horror film promin refer to in `` scream `` with one of the best bad guy motiv ever put on paper . 
all thi and a `` scream 3 `` is in the work . 
know the seri ' tendenc for self-refer , perhap one of it charact will again discuss the concept of sequel justic . 
mention `` scream 2 `` 'll help them in their argument .
