`` veri bad thing , `` is the most delight morbid film of the year , a movi that goe so far over the deep end with it outrag and violenc that i could n't help but be won over by the materi . 
the film start off with five friend leav their home in lo angel for a bachelor parti in la vega . 
the groom-to-b is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be marri to the control , wedding-obsess laura ( cameron diaz ) . 
the other friend are real estat agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charl ( leland orser ) , and brother , michael ( jeremi piven ) and famili man adam ( daniel stern ) . 
after a wild night of gambl , booz , and drug , a stripper ( carla scott ) who wa paid for by robert come into their hotel room , but after a freak accid , to everyon 's terror , she is kill . 
as robert put it : `` there are two option : go to the polic and go to prison , or buri her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . `` 
after a secur guard enter into the hotel room unexpectantli and see the bodi , robert is forc to kill him as well . 
`` okay , there is onli one option now . 
you can forget about call the polic , `` he say . 
by the time the five friend return home and as the wed draw nearer , most of them are overcom with guilt , which set off an even more elabor seri of event , that includ much , much more murder , double-cross , and the inevit wed from hell . 
`` veri bad thing , `` which is actor peter berg 's featur film direct debut , is the shockingli pervers and wick comedi that , `` there 's someth about mari , `` want to be . 
it pull out all the stop to creat someth fresh , origin , and hilari , even if that requir surprisingli graphic violenc , gore , and a slew of truli hate charact that all get what they deserv by the end . 
the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildli , veri funni and courag . 
dure the second act of the film , some of the fun wa begin to slightli dwindl due to so much death , which wa begin to undermin the humor , but it eventu recoup itself with a climax that ha to be seen to be believ . 
the dialogu is edgi and invent , and thi film prove that a movi doe n't necessarili requir likabl charact to be extrem enjoy . 
there 's more fun , i think , in show ignor peopl get their just dessert . 
cameron diaz give her best perform to date here , and ha a lot of fun in play the hate laura , who eventu turn out to be more crazi than ani of the five male friend . 
diaz put so much overblown energi to her charact that i realli do think she deserv a support actress oscar nomin come next januari . 
by the time she is beat someon to death with a coat hanger , and recit line like , `` stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstair , `` i could n't help but crack up at how `` balls-to-the-wal `` thi film had becom . 
jeann tripplehorn creat anoth charact origin , as daniel stern 's wife , who late in the pictur , we discov , is a tough kick-box that should not be mess around with . 
it is at thi level that , `` veri bad thing , `` wa so entertain and surpris . 
just when you thought you could predict what wa go to happen , there would be a littl twist involv the charact that would be absolut wacki . 
the last sequenc wa perfect and manag to go even further over-the-top . 
although i enjoy the film immens , let me make thi clear : `` veri bad thing , `` is not a movi for everyon . 
it is more tasteless than anyth i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloodi than a r-rate film usual is , and it is offens . 
luckili , these are element that i would prefer in a comedi , sinc it clearli show the filmmak were set on make a no-holds-bar , polit incorrect comedi . 
the fact that thi film slip through the crack of the usual mainstream and `` safe `` wide-releas come out late , still give me hope for the hollywood film industri .
