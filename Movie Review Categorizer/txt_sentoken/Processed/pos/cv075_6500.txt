well , i know that stallon is 50 year old now , but in daylight he doe n't look it ! 
daylight is a great disast movi . 
if you 've seen cliffhang , you 'll know stallon 's charact alreadi . 
a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time . 
a tunnel connect new york and new jersey ha both side collaps when a group of robber collid with a truck carri * veri * flammabl toxic wast . 
a dozen or so peopl surviv the collaps and the inciner firebal ( and what a fire ball it wa ! ) 
stallon , a former emerg medic servic man , is chauffeur a rich coupl around , when they reach the outsid of the tunnel , befor the explos . 
then , 30 minut into the movi , boom ! 
> from here on , the plot take a back seat , and we are treat to some of the best camera work and action stage . 
most all the action is plausibl and will hold you at the edg of your seat . 
there are a few melodramat part here , but , they tend to work out well . 
there is no gener antagonist in thi film , but the action and suspens make you forget all about that . 
daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matine show of it , and i thought it wa worth everi penni . 
the character are mostli flat , one dimesion , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the charact . 
rob cohen ( dragonheart ) doe a great job with thi film .
