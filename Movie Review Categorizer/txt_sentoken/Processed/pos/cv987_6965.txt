tree loung is the director debut from one of my favorit actor , steve buscemi . 
he gave memor perform in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dog . 
now he tri hi hand at write , direct and act all in the same flick . 
the movi start out aw slow with tommi ( buscemi ) hang around a local bar the `` tree loung `` and him pester hi brother . 
it 's obviou he a loser . 
but as he say `` it 's better i 'm a loser and know i am , then be a loser and not think i am . `` 
well put . 
the stori start to take off when hi uncl die , and tommi , not have a job , decid to drive an ice cream truck . 
well , the movi start to pick up with him find a love interest in a 17 year old girl name debbi ( chloe sevigni ) and . . . 
i like thi movi alot even though it did not reach my expect . 
after you 've seen him in fargo and reservoir dog , you know he is capabl of a better perform . 
i think hi brother , michael , did an excel job for hi debut perform . 
mr . buscemi is off to a good career as a director !
