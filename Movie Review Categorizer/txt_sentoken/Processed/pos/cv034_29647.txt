plot : derek zooland is a male model . 
he is also veri dumb and impression . 
for that reason , he is secretli hire and train ( so secret , that even he doe n't know about it ) by an underground fashion syndic to assassin the prime minist of malaysia , who want to abolish child labor in hi countri . 
will zooland fulfil the dirti deed ? 
will zooland ever grace the world hi new `` look `` ? 
is thi a funni movi ? 
find out below . . . 
critiqu : there 's a place in our world for `` stupid comedi `` . 
film which do n't pretend to take themselv serious , are base on idiot premis and fill with dumb joke . 
there 's also a time for them and mani would argu that thi difficult period of our histori , might be an ideal circumst dure which to `` relax `` by watch someth so complet frivol . 
well , if you 're in the mood for some serious mindless entertain , ben stiller and hi cast of mani have assembl one of the more origin dumb comedi in some time . 
of cours , comedi as such are usual veri subject and i could see how some will see thi film simpli as stupid and unfunni , while other will grant them the `` stupid `` , but consid it funni instead . 
i person enjoy it for the most part , crack up loudli dure a coupl of specif sequenc and love the derek zooland charact and the unrestrain whip they releas upon the fashion industri . 
snap ! 
it wa also nice to see sever real-lif model with small role in the movi , not take themselv too serious . 
and if you 're the type of person who like celebr cameo in film , well , do n't look ani further becaus dozen of famou face show up here includ vinc vaughn , billi zane , winona ryder , christian slater , david duchovni , natali portman and mani , mani other . 
i especi like andi dick 's complet make-ov as the masseus . 
hi-lari ! 
but with all film of thi type , there is bound to be some stuff that simpli doe n't work . 
a few particular which did n't strike my fanci includ the bulimia and `` orgi `` sequenc with christin taylor , the break-danc fight , and i also never get whi they use real countri in plot like thi ( whi not just `` make up `` a countri , instead of zero in on a certain peopl ? ) . 
i also could have done with less of the taylor charact in gener , sinc she wa n't all that interest and seem to slow thing down everi now and then ( more zooland , dude ! ) . 
but those few misstep were noth compar to some of the more memor scene which definit did work for me ! 
i almost piss myself dure the `` ga station `` disast , absolut ador the `` walk-off `` contest ( with david bowi as the judg , no less ) and appreci mani of zooland 's moron one-lin ( `` i wa a merman . . . a 
merman ! ! `` ) . 
and i dare you to get hi `` monkey `` photo shoot out of your head after see thi movi ( `` you 're a monkey , derek . . . a 
monkey ! `` ) 
i also realli like the soundtrack and the pace of the film , both of which zip and zag , and establish a nice rhythm to it all . 
again , it 's to note that thi movi is dumb and not for everyon , but my guess is that if you laugh at the trailer , you will like enjoy mani of the quip in the actual pictur as well . 
if you thought the trailer wa dumb , skip thi dodo bird and go rent austin power again or someth , a film from which there is an obviou influenc here . 
blue steel , babi . . . yeah ! ! !
