the 1990 produc two brilliant scienc fiction film . 
one wa _gattaca_ . 
the other wa _the thirteenth floor_ . 
just as _gattaca_ wa overshadow by the mighti _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ wa releg to obscur by _the matrix_ . 
howev , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deal with similar theme , is a much better movi than the frenet , childish and improb _matrix_ . 
a cut edg comput scientist , hannon fuller ( play by the charm armin mueller-stahl ) , is murder . 
hi associ , dougla hall , ( craig bierko ) appar frame and suspect by the polic , enter into the simul world they have creat in order to unravel the mysteri . 
along the way a beauti blond ( gretchen mol ) , more bodi , and a deepen mysteri about simul world complic the pictur . 
_the thirteenth floor_ unfold slowli and telegraph it punch , choos to elicit the more complex emot respons of empathi and anticip rather than the cheap one of mere surpris . 
the result is a movi that is a failur from two convent point of view . 
first , it plot revel can be foreseen if one ha care follow it complex storylin . 
second and more serious , it demand that it audienc think and feel . 
no wonder it fell through the crack . 
done in film noir style as a murder mysteri , thi is a rel deep movi that function on sever level . 
mani audienc will simpli be bewild by it , rather than engag , which is a shame , becaus thi movi ampli repay a littl emot and intellectu invest . 
i recommend a second view simpli to get the flavor of the frequent iron foreshadow in the open part of the movi . 
despit it philosoph challeng , _the thirteenth floor_ deriv it emot forc from the love stori between jane fuller ( mol ) and dougla hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between dougla hall and hannon fuller . 
in that sens it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of it cute philosoph byplay , is an adolesc movi with no emot depth whatsoev . 
the moment when jane fuller confess her love for dougla hall is at onc satisfi , wrench and intellectu challeng . 
in it final moment the film even take on itself , when david , jane 's husband , who ha come to enjoy kill , accus her of be the sick one . 
although there is a victori for the lead charact , thi resolut suggest a disturb element of fantasi in jane , and thu a deep-seat charact flaw . 
in fact , hannon fuller 's activ in the simul world , the behavior of jane 's husband , and the effect of enter the simul on dougla hall all hint at similar issu with those charact . 
thi is not a film of good peopl beset from without by great evil . 
the tragedi is not in their star , but in themselv . 
the major actor , all of whom are requir to play two or even three role , perform extrem well . 
bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstand . 
d'onofrio as whitney , who play a pivot role in support , also turn in a good perform . 
the love gretchen mol , whose eleg , integr , and determin suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , doe a wonder job . 
her voic , howev , lack the necessari weight at time . 
thi could be becaus she wa given the worst line in a movi whose major weak is the script . 
some minor flaw , hairlin crack in fine porcelain , appear in place . 
there are one or two instanc of jerki edit . 
the script take the edg off the film 's climax . 
the atmospher becom too claustrophob at time ( yet , there is a clue there too ) . 
one wonder if even after two decad , _blade runner_ is still cast it long shadow over sci-fi film . 
one can see a group of suit in their suit , wave their hand imperi at director like the emperor in _amadeus_ : `` make it more like_blad runner_ , you know , dark and raini . `` 
_the thirteen floor_ is that rare except among hollywood movi : a , rich , emot satisfi , intellig sci-fi movi . 
and yet , ultim , it prove the suit right . 
for when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf commun turn out in drove to see it ? 
if we do n't support great sf , who will ?
