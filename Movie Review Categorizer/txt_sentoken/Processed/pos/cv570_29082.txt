plot : a group of asbesto cleaner get a job remov the gunk from an old insan asylum . 
as each day pass , the crew member begin to discov thing about the place and themselv which set other thing in motion . 
say anyth els about the plot would be a crime . 
have fun . . . 
critiqu : `` i feel like shoot myself in the head `` are the first word that came out of my mouth after see thi movi , a good indic as to what kind of film to expect here . 
thi ai n't your averag `` happi go lucki `` kind of pictur . 
thi is a deliber slow-pac mystery-horror film drench in atmospher , with a veri creepi insan asylum ( in which most of the film take place ) , veri few clue up-front and lot to talk about afterward . 
will it bore some peopl to sleep ? 
you bet it will ! 
is it made for the scream audienc of the day ? 
absolut not ! 
i guess you can describ thi film as a horror movi for the `` cerebr crowd `` . 
a film that patient unwrap itself frame after frame , give away veri littl with each step and each sound , unwind itself until it final scene offer up a world of revel and plenti more to discuss later . 
i 've alway love movi that have me talk about them afterward like the shine and lost highway and thi film fit right into that group . 
in fact , i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describ thi kind of movi is a `` mindfuck `` . 
if you feel like watch a movi that move veri slowli , give you a hand of charact with diverg background , toss a few veri ambigu and supernatur cooki your way and is extrem disturb onc you put it all togeth , well , then thi movi is definit for you ! 
it 's the kind of film that you actual have to see twice to fulli appreci ( damn , i miss that whole `` peanut butter `` thing ! ) and one that will like creep the shit out of you if watch alon in the dark . 
`` brrrrrrrrr . . . now 
what wa that sound in the basement ? 
honey , can you go check ? `` 
and one thing thi film doe n't have , unlik it hollywood-ian counterpart like the haunt , is special effect . 
in fact , that 's one of the greater thing about thi movi : it feel real becaus it look like it 's actual tape on video with veri credibl actor in veri credibl circumst ( i did some research and it wa , in fact , shot on digit video . . . ah-ha ! ) . 
anoth great thing about it is that it 's actual veri gori and somewhat violent in theme , and yet we rare see anyth of the sort on the big screen ( it 's mostli impli , kid ! ) . 
and as clich ? d as it might be to say . . . it 's usual much scarier when stuff is left to our imagin or impli in movi as such . 
other film that thi one remind me of includ henri : portrait of a serial killer and the blair witch project , with that same real sens of dread , brood and terror . 
the film doe howev move aw slow and if you realli do n't get `` into `` it complet ( you realli need to concentr here ) , you will lose the motion of the stori and the pent-up tension might be releas . 
but overal , thi film is yet anoth great exampl of the horror genr make a veri cool comeback thi year with no tight tanktop in sight . 
and with david caruso act like the king hotshot like onli he can , how can you go wrong ? 
definit not a film for everyon but a must-se for anyon look to throw themselv into the psych of the disturb ( count me in ! ) . 
stanley kubrick would be proud ! 
oh yeah . . . so 
where 's that gun again . . . ? 
where 's joblo come from ?
