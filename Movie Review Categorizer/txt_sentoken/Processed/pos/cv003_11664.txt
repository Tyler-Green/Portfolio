`` jaw `` is a rare film that grab your attent befor it show you a singl imag on screen . 
the movi open with black , and onli distant , alien-lik underwat sound . 
then it come , the first omin bar of compos john william ' now infam score . 
dah-dum . 
from there , director steven spielberg wast no time , take us into the water on a midnight swim with a beauti girl that turn deadli . 
right away he let us know how vulner we all are float in the ocean , and onc `` jaw `` ha attack , it never relinquish it grip . 
perhap what is most outstand about `` jaw `` is how spielberg build the movi . 
he work it like a theatric product , with a first act and a second act . 
unlik so mani modern filmmak , he ha a great deal of restraint , and refus to show us the shark until the middl of the second act . 
until then , he mere suggest it presenc with creepi , subject underwat shot and william ' music . 
he 's build the tension bit by bit , so when it come time for the climax , the shark 's arriv is truli terrifi . 
he doe n't let us get bore with the imageri . 
the first act open with polic chief martin brodi ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who ha taken an easi , peac job run the polic station on amiti island , a fictiti new england resort town where there ha n't been a murder or a gun fire in 25 year . 
the island is shaken up by sever viciou great white shark attack right befor the fourth of juli , and the mayor , larri vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doe n't want to shut down the beach becaus the island is reliant on summer tourist money . 
brodi is join by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambiti shark expert from the marin institut . 
hooper is as fascin by the shark as he is determin to help brodi stop it -- hi knowledg about the exact work of the shark ( `` it 's a perfect engin , an eat machin `` ) make it that much more terrifi . 
when vaughn final relent , hooper and brodi join a crusti old shark killer name quint ( robert shaw ) on hi decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . 
the entir second act take place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevit , are hunt by it . 
`` jaw `` is a thriller with a keen sens of humor and an incred sens of pace , tension , and horror . 
it is like ten movi all roll into one , and it 's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , take in enough money to crown it the box offic champ of all time ( until it wa unceremoni dethron in 1977 by `` star war `` ) . 
even today , fascin with thi film is on par with hitchcock 's `` psycho , `` and it never seem to age . 
although grand new technolog exist that make the technic sequenc , includ sever mechan shark , obsolet , none of it could improv the film becaus it onli would lead to overkil . 
the technic limit face by spielberg in 1975 may have actual produc a better film becaus it forc him to reli on tradit cinemat element like pace , character , sharp edit , and creativ photographi , instead of simpli dous the audienc with digit shark effect . 
scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actor at the time `` jaw `` wa made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . 
nevertheless , thi film guarante them all success career becaus each gave an outstand perform and refus to be overshadow by the shark . 
scheider hit just the right note as a sympathet husband and father caught in the polit quagmir of do what 's right and go against the entir town . 
`` it 's your first summer here , you know , `` mayor vaughn warn him . 
dreyfuss , who had previous been seen in `` american graffiti `` ( 1973 ) and `` the apprenticeship of duddi kravitz `` ( 1974 ) give a surprisingli matur , complex perform for someon who had liter onli play kid and teenag . 
howev , most outstand is the gnarl perform by robert shaw as the movi 's captain ahab , a perform sore overlook by the academi award . 
border of parodi , shaw play quint as a grizzl old loner whose machismo border on masoch . 
he 's slightli derang , and shaw 's perform is almost a caricatur . 
howev , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brodi and hooper are below deck on the orca compar scar . 
quint is drawn into tell the stori of hi experi aboard the u . s . s . 
indianapoli , a navi ship in world war ii that wa sunk by the japanes . 
hi tale of float in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarm of shark slowli devour them them is actual more hair-rais than anyth spielberg put on screen . 
shaw deliv the stori in one long take , and it is the best act in the film . 
of cours , we ca n't leav out the shark itself ; with it black eye , endless row of teeth , and insati urg to eat , it is basic the epitom of all mankind 's fear about what is unknown and threaten in natur . 
a shark is such a perfect nemesi it is real -- have surviv sinch the dinosaur , great white do exist , they can be as larg as the shark in `` jaw , `` and they are a threat . 
everi one of spielberg 's subject underwat shot make us feel queasi becaus let us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writih , dangl , complet unprotect leg just readi to be chomp into . 
the shark in `` jaw `` wa actual a combin of actual footag and five differ mechan shark ( all nicknam `` bruce `` by the crew ) built to be shot from differ angl . 
mani have forgotten , but `` jaw `` wa a sort of precursor to `` waterworld `` ( 1995 ) , a movi 's who soggi product and cost overrun had univers studio worri about a bomb . 
but , as we can see now , spielberg overcam all the obstacl , and deliv one of the finest primal scare-thril ever to come out of hollywood .
