let 's face it : the $ 100 million-plu smash that wa `` goldeney `` wa not a good film by ani mean , and as a bond movi wa onli margin better than , say , `` a view to a kill `` or either of the timothi dalton pictur , by virtu of nice pace . 
but it did reviv the seri , and grant the produc some new direct in which to take the it ( ie . 
the new `` m `` is a woman ) . 
`` tomorrow never die `` is the pictur `` goldeney `` should have been ; it 's also the most entertain bond outing sinc `` the spi who love me `` . 
the new pictur open with china consid war with britain after a standard militari oper is misconstru as a hostil threat from an english submarin . 
as an attack occur , the front-pag headlin is alreadi be prepar , courtesi of carver media . 
carver ( pryce ) the man is a delud magnat , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gate , and peter sellar ' german scientist from `` dr . 
strangelov `` ( physic , pryce even recal sellar in hi kubrick day ) . 
it 's up to jame bond to take him down , with assist , of cours , from a wealth of gadget ( includ a multi-purpos cell phone ) , and beauti women . 
enter michel yeoh , fresh from `` supercop `` , as a chines secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgl , dispatch baddi seemingli with the eas of prepar pasta , and refus the advanc of our philand hero . 
they make a great team . 
`` tomorrow never die `` is a surprisingli entertain and effici film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of `` turner & hooch `` . 
spottiswood ha craft some breathtak set piec , each much more intric and impress than , for instanc , the tank scene in `` goldeney `` . 
moreov , brosnan ha at last settl into the role some feel he wa born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchis rest on hi shoulder , and there wa notic discomfort in hi bodi languag . 
return in brosnan 's eye ha some of the play he demonstr for so mani year on tv 's `` remington steel `` , as ha hi deadpan wit . 
and though carver 's motiv are muddi ( when carver explain that `` geniu is insan with some success `` , screenwrit fierstein is take a lazi shortcut ) , pryce make an agreeabl , memor villain . 
in the futur , they should pursu actor as talent and experienc as pryce to breath life into these cardboard figur . 
there a few too mani explos in `` tomorrow never die `` , perhap so mani they qualifi as dialogu . 
and it could have use a sharper script , though i wa amus by the doubl entendr , none of which i will reveal here . 
as it stand , the plot suffer mani hole ( i 'm not take about implaus ) , and the dialogu tend toward the hackney . 
now that the element are in place : modern special effect and stunt work , cool pierc brosnan , kickass femal alli . . . 
it 's time to put them to use in someth truli special . 
there 's no mistak , howev , that `` tomorrow never die `` is ideal holiday escap , and for the first time in perhap year , you 'll walk out want more bond movi .
