the relax dude ride a roller coaster 
the big lebowski a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman 
the most surreal situat are ordinari everyday life as view by an outsid . 
when those observ are joel and ethan coen , the surreal becom bizarr . 
when the life is that of jeff `` the dude `` leboswki , the bizarr fall over the edg into the world of `` what'sgoingonaroundher `` . 
the marvel sound of `` the stranger `` ( sam elliot ) 's voice-ov introduc the film . 
at least it doe until he forget what he wa go to say and give up . 
the dude ( jeff bridg ) is describ as the `` laziest man in lo angel , possibl the world `` , although he 's not so much sloth as he is relax . 
spend the last 30 year with a roach clip in one hand and a white russian in the other , he doe n't have much of a life , but he 's have a good time . 
when ask what he doe for fun , he respond `` bowl , drive around and the occasion acid flashback `` . 
lebowski 's passion is bowl . 
when he 's not roll the ball down an alley toward a strike , thing just happen to him . 
arriv home one night , he 's beaten by thug attempt to collect money that hi wife owe them . 
even wors , they urin on hi rug . 
the problem is that the dude doe n't have a wife . 
hi assail realiz that their target is a differ lebowski when they glanc around at hi apart . 
the `` big `` lebowski ( david huddleston ) is a multi-millionair and hi dude live in two-room squalor . 
the next day , our ragtag hero visit hi namesak 's mansion attempt compens for hi soak rug . 
the carpet is import to him becaus it pull the room togeth : not surprisingli sinc it 's virtual the onli object there . 
when he 's deni ani money , he pick up a replac rug off the floor . 
on hi way out , he run into lebowski 's trophi babe wife bunni ( tara reid ) who offer to perform a sexual act that , accord to rumor , is one of bill clinton 's favorit for a thousand buck . 
the penniless dude wisecrack that he 's head for the cash machin . 
later he get an unexpect phone call enlist hi aid in be the bag man to deliv a ransom to bunni 's kidnapp . 
thi begin the trademark coen brother crimes-gone-wrong sequenc . 
the kidnapp are imposs inept . 
the dude and hi croni are even wors . 
everi plan goe awri . 
you can almost see lebowski 's brain churn in slow motion as he tri to figur out the clue . 
that 's the stori , but to tell the truth it doe n't much matter . 
there could be almost ani plot and the film would be just as entertain . 
the narr onli exist so we can watch the offbeat charact and the quirki predica they fall into . 
the dude 's bowl buddi walter ( john goodman ) and donni ( steve buscemi ) look like peopl you 'd see on the street but , like everyth els in thi film , they 're not quit what they seem . 
walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixti . 
everyth that happen remind him of a situat in the nam . 
when a fellow bowler cross the foul line but wo n't admit it , walter pull a gun on him until he mark a zero on the score sheet . 
donni get preciou few word in between walter 's scream and the dude 's rambl . 
when he doe , walter shout him down with horrend albeit seemingli unintent bowl pun . 
donni is `` out of hi leagu `` and doe n't `` have a frame of refer `` . 
the film is pepper with peopl for whom the term `` charact `` would be an understat . 
the big lebowski 's daughter maud , an avant-gard `` vagin `` artist , paint while swing nake in a leather apparatu like an s & m mari martin . 
the kidnapp are german techno nihilist biker . 
bunni lebowski is a high school cheerlead turn porno star . 
most impress is john turturro in hi far too small role as a hispan bowler . 
as the flamenco music swell , we see him put on hi lavend hose . 
the camera pan up to an all-purpl skin-tight bowl outfit with `` jesu `` ( pronounc with a `` j `` , not an `` h `` ) embroid on the pocket . 
he address the lane with intens serious and one paint fingernail . 
hi tongu slowli snake out and lovingli lick the glow bowl ball . 
bridg work the dude as if he had been live him for decad and mayb he ha . 
i ca n't think of anyon els who could have done a better job . 
buscemi ha a limit role , but he play it perfectli . 
the more that i see john goodman the more convinc i am that he 's one of the treasur of our time . 
it 's odd to think that most of the world know him onli as roseann barr 's televis husband . 
more like the coen 's `` rais arizona `` than their hit `` fargo `` , `` the big lebowski `` demand an open mind and even more open eye . 
a mark of the coen brother is that even with all wonder dream sequenc and the broad slapstick physic comedi on the screen , much of the humor is subtl and easi to miss . 
there 's so much go on that frequent it disappear befor you can see it . 
walk out of the theater , i felt that the film had someth import to say . 
on further examin , i wa n't sure exactli what it wa . 
`` if you meet jesu at the bowl alley , it 's not go to be what you expect `` ? 
`` when the go get weird , the weird go bowl `` ? 
mayb there 's no real messag . 
perhap it 's just a roller coaster ride through a hilari world . 
mayb that 's enough . 
( michael redman ha written thi column for 23 year and just realiz that he wa so taken with the dude that he ran out of space to talk about `` the man in the iron mask `` star that favorit of 14-year-old girl of all age .
