there is marc renton ( who narrat ) , spud ( the dim-wit one ) sick boy ( the sean conneri obsess ) , and begbe ( the violenc obsess ) . 
power by a top rate , but not top name soundtrack ( iggi pop , sleeper , elastica , lou reed . . . ) the film follow renton who get clean , get back into heroin and get clean again . 
some of the wit in thi movi is sharp and pulp fiction-esqu , and some is just dumb & dumber gross ( the bed sheet ) and stupid ( the bb gun ) although the film start out on a comic note , it take a sharp term in the middl , and becom almost depress .
