when andi leav for cowboy camp , hi mother hold a yard sale and scroung in hi room for old toy . 
one of these toy is wheezi , a penguin with a broken squeaker . 
woodi ( tom hank ) saddl up andi 's dog and ride out into the yard to rescu wheezi . 
woodi succe in hi mission , but doe n't make it back to the hous befor al , the unscrupul owner of al 's toy barn , recogn woodi as a rare collector 's item and steal him . 
buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) lead hamm ( john ratzenberg ) , mr . potato head ( don rickl ) , slinki dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallac shawn ) into the citi to find their friend . 
meanwhil woodi discov the reason he wa kidnap . 
al ha collect everi piec of merchandis from the 1950 's tv puppet show `` woodi 's round-up `` except for a woodi doll . 
now that the collect is complet , al plan to sell woodi and hi round-up gang-bullsey the hors , jessi the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinki pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan . 
the gang is happi about the move ; they 've been in storag for year wait for woodi . 
if woodi doe n't go with them , they 'll be close up in a dark box again , possibl forev . 
tri to convinc him to stay with them , jessi tell woodi how she wa abandon when her owner grew up , and woodi realiz that hi day as a belov toy are number . 
while woodi ponder whether to go to japan or to go home to andi , buzz and the boy invad al 's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replac by anoth buzz who doe n't know he 's a toy . 
the new buzz gener the movi 's biggest laugh as he lead the other toy in an assault on `` zurg 's fortress `` ( i . e . , al 's apart build ) . 
the origin `` toy stori `` won me over becaus it central theme reflect a grown-up sensibl rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear . 
while most kid ' movi take the posit that everi person is special and ha an extraordinari destini to fulfil , in `` toy stori `` buzz discov that he wa n't special , that he wa just like everyon els . 
buzz sank into a suicid depress , but woodi show buzz that be a toy wa worthwhil becaus a toy is love and a toy make a child happi . 
in other word , it 's okay to be ordinari if you have love and a purpos in your life . 
most of us probabl come to the same conclus when we realiz that we 're not space ranger and we 're never go to be . 
`` toy stori 2 `` address the question rais by the conclus drawn by the first movi . 
woodi is forc to recogn that andi will grow up and forget him and that he will like be discard , abandon , or seal up in a dark box in the attic . 
thi is anoth big grown-up theme : everyth end . 
the theme is introduc earli in the movi when woodi 's arm is torn and andi place him on a shelf rather than take him to cowboy camp . 
on the shelf , woodi meet wheezi , who 's dusti , broken , and forgotten . 
the other toy are shock that woodi ha been `` shelv , `` and they worri that woodi 's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicid attempt . 
after he 's stolen , woodi ha to decid between a long life in a display case and an uncertain futur with andi and hi pal . 
of cours , in spite of the heavi theme `` toy stori 2 `` explor , it 's also veri funni . 
most of the laugh come from the toy ' assault on al 's toy barn and on the apart build . 
the brief substitut of a new , still delusion buzz wa a welcom surpris ; i 'd wonder how a sequel could be as funni as the origin without the pompou attitud buzz display in the origin . 
most of the vocal perform are first-rat . 
tom hank stand out for the level of enthusiasm he put into hi work . 
howev , one voice-ov also stand out as horribl miscast . 
kelsey grammer sound noth like an old prospector . 
although he doe a lot of voice-ov work in commerci and on `` the simpson `` ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer onli make slight variat on hi own voic . 
he doe n't have the rang to pull off a role like stinki pete . 
the anim is even better than in the first . 
especi impress were the textur of the figur . 
we can now see the differ between flesh and plastic ; in the first movi the peopl look just like the toy , but now human skin look soft and ha a slight bluish tint . 
we can also see that bo peep is porcelain . 
as you can tell from the long-wind phrase common in the merchandis -- `` disney and pixar 's 'toy stori 2 ' `` -- thi is pixar 's come out parti . 
to celebr they append their first project , a hilari short about two desklamp and a rubber ball , to the begin of the movi . 
they made the short in 1986 , which is incred when one consid the rel primit level of comput technolog avail then . 
on the downsid , `` toy stori 2 `` follow the formula of the origin so close that the sequel come off a bit stale , and some section tend to drag . 
overal , though , i had a great time and found `` stori 2 `` to be a worthi successor to the first `` toy stori . `` 
bottom line : thi one realli is fun for the whole famili !
