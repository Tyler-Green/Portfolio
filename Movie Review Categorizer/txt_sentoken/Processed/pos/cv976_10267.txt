robert redford 's a river run through it is not a film i watch often . 
it is a masterpiec -- one of the better film of recent year . 
until 1994 , it wa my second favorit film of all time . 
the act and direct is top-notch -- never sappi , alway touch . 
a friend of mine onc report that he avoid it becaus `` i wa afraid it would just be realli polit correct , and tick me off . `` 
all i could do wa tell him to go in unbias , and enjoy . 
it is one of the few movi that ha complet reduc me to tear . 
but certain memori should not often be rereleas -- in the last few shot , you have to cri . 
upon my first view i left bawl . 
it is not flawless -- but it is so veri good , that you ca n't help but be effect . 
the open is danger nolstalg and sentiment -- watch these shot of peopl who have been dead so long , give you a feel of perspect and histori observ that you will find in veri few other film . 
martin scorses onc describ the movi as a dream state -- like take dope , and immers yourself in an altern world . 
that is what a river run through it doe . 
it exploit the uniqu power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self . 
both time i 've seen it , it been hard ( again to quot scorses ) wake up . 
but the dream is love .
