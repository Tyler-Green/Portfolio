tbwp is probabl the singl most profit film ever . 
not surpris , consid it tini us $ 100 , 000 budget , to date it ha earn in excess of us $ 130 million . 
that 's a shock 100 time profit ! 
rumour have it that a smart internet ` market ' ploy wa so success in gain cult-lik fanat , by word of mouth coupl with string of excel review , the film just explod in the box-offic , rake in million on it open weekend . 
shot in 16mm and video ( i suspect . ) , the film chronicl the foray of 3 student who go in search for the legendari blair witch . 
audienc are put in the first-person perspect in the entir mis-adventur , often wobbl and blurri at time , it take a bit of get use to in the begin . 
thi is suppos to be the materi they discov in the wood where the 3 disappear ; edit and put onto the screen for the benefit of our audienc . 
tbwp is simpli smart . 
film to look as if it wa realli a stock-shoot by a bunch of student in search of the blair witch as a school project , one may suspect ( like your truli ) that it simpli a lazi but smart approach to film-mak . 
simpli amaz in that respect , i must say . 
talk about impact , oh ye , tbwp doe have quit a bit , in fact most audienc will find it deepli disturb . 
i did , especi the last bit but i 'm not reveal more . 
you have to see it for yourself . 
i ca n't help but feel a tad cheat after know how commerci success thi film ha becom . 
could it be that final , an indie-film ha unwittingli found a formula for commerci appeal ? 
or wa it all simpli a ploy by the big player right from the begin ? 
well , i guess the fact stay ; tbwp is highli origin , clever and will most definit leav most with someth dread to talk and think about for week prior to watch thi film . 
no gore , no special effect , i just ca n't get over how terribl smart thi film is !
