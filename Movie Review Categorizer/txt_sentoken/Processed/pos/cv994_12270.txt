critiqu : ever wonder what would happen if your better half turn out to be someon other than the person that you had come to cherish and love ? 
well , if you ever have , then thi film is definit for you . 
it is n't the most origin premis in the world , but it is handl pretti well here , and pretti quickli for that matter ( a speedi 90 minut ) . 
i think one of the main reason thi film work for me is the groundbreak perform by mark wahlberg ( of boogi night infami ( 7 . 5/10 ) . 
he complet captur all the good , and bad , of the main charact of thi film , and alway kept me want to see more and more of him ( hi perform score him a solid nomin from hi core target audienc , as `` best villain `` at the 1997 mtv movi award ) . 
the soundtrack is also veri effect in thi set , and of cours , the slutti perform by alyssa milano is someth we could all indulg in ( look for the nice bikini and butt shot . . . if 
you 're into that kind of thing , that is : ) . 
i did n't much care for the father/david relationship which seem to be a littl too contriv , but for the most part , i wa realli into thi movi . 
then again , daddi dearest did have one of the coolest line in the movi when hi wife is ask him what the `` big deal `` wa about hi daughter date david . 
hi repli : `` the big deal is that the guy give me the creep , and the girl is my daughter . `` 
good point . 
all in all , the movi kick some fun ass , mindless as it wa , and effect demonstr everi parent 's worst nightmar . 
mind you , i still ca n't tell if rees witherspoon is good look or a douchebag , but hey , life goe on . 
and on a person note , we final decid to add some taco meat onto our nacho fiesta of usual , and let me tell you all . . . it wa a flame success ! ! 
anoth firm recommend by joe schmoe !
