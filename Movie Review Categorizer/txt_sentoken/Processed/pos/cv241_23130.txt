there wa a lot ride on thi movi . 
everyon even moder interest in the `` scream `` seri wa die to know how it would end . 
what would be the `` final act `` ? 
thi is the end of an era for them , a movi which ha kept them up night search for clue on the internet , talk and toss around rumor with their equal enthus buddi , and , for kid under 17 , those elabor plot consist of buy a ticket to one movi and hop into `` scream `` while narrowli escap those menac usher who are onli a year or two older than themselv . 
no need to worri ; `` scream 3 `` is endlessli invent and entertain , a fine epilogu to the seri that made kevin williamson a household name , reinvent the horror genr , and continu in the self-referenti , post-modern tradit of quentin and co . 
so , how doe the stori go ? 
as oppos to what some fanat internet site would have you believ , sidney prescott ( neve campbel ) , now all-grown-up and constantli deal with her pass in the constantli torment sector of her psych , is not live in hollywood fulfil her dream to becom an actress , but rather in upstat california , live , understand , alon in the confin of fenc and vast secur system . 
she work at home as a crisi center affili over the phone . 
but that ? ? ? s not where the movi start off . 
instead , in a tactic that remind me of the somewhat similar , and conceptu horrifi , sequenc in `` eye for an eye `` ( 1995 ) , cotton weari ( liev schreiber ) , now a big star , drive home to hi girlfriend in traffic when the killer call , demand the locat of sidney ? ? ? s home , and , when he doesn ? ? ? t get it , threaten the life of cotton ? ? ? s girlfriend christin , and cotton can ? ? ? t do anyth to stop him . 
the rest of the sequenc is particularli clever , set up a constant throughout the pictur : the killer ha a high-tech electron voice-chang that top that of the first two . 
not onli doe he sound unmistak like talent voice-ov artist roger jackson ( ha , ha ) , he can now easili duplic the voic of the lead charact , includ sidney , and the return gale weather ( courtney cox arquett ) and dewey riley ( david arquett ) . 
at the same time , stab 3 , the third film-within-a-film base around the charact and event of woodsboro and windsor colleg , ha taken a less authent approach thi time around in return to woodsboro ; wherea the account of the first two film wa true , the franchis within `` scream `` ha now becom total fiction . 
nevertheless , we learn , cotton made an appear in the movi which is now in product , as himself to be kill off in the first scene . 
so , it seem that the real killer is of our hero in the order in which they bite it in the movi ? ? 'either the actor portray them , or the real thing . 
sometim both . 
clever , inde . 
but , who goe next ? 
no one know . 
three differ script were pen , we ? ? ? re told , to keep the true final off the internet ( a nod to the `` scream `` 2 fiasco a few year back ) and no one know for sure which one the killer read . 
still , all the while sidney stay conceal in her home , onli visit dad for the first half-hour of the film , while also have horrifi vision of her mother , which take us back a bit to sidney ? ? ? s fear of becom what her mother wa ? ? 'or , at least , what her mother wa secretli . 
when sidney final ventur out to hollywood as the murder becom more preval , she ? ? ? s chase onto the set of stab 3 , wander through `` woodsboro , `` written and direct as an odd , surreal , nightmar inde , thi is one of `` scream 3 `` ? ? ? s finest moment . 
okay , over the year , i ? ? ? ll admit that i ? ? ? ve becom quit the `` scream `` fan . 
no , i don ? ? ? t have the ghostfac costum or the director ? ? ? s cut laserdisc , but i often find myself compel to pop in the dvd of either member of the preced duo , and can get quit caught up in the dramat element of these film ( ye , i said `` dramat element `` ) , sometim debat with famili and friend the possibl and endless theori that have becom quintessenti affili with `` scream `` . 
throughout the film , though , i notic a much more subtl approach than the other two film . 
grant that there ? ? ? s stabbin-a-plenti go on throughout , but there ? ? ? s consider less blood , less gore . 
honestli , i like thi approach . 
it ? ? ? s more classic , more rebelli , constantli demonstr the capabl direct of we craven . 
he know when to hold back and at the same time make the movi ooz with energi , illustr the delic pois flow from hi year of experi . 
some critic have note that `` scream 3 `` seem to take itself more serious thi time ; mayb so , or mayb screenwrit ehren kruger ( arlington road ) , who took over after williamson had schedul conflict , saw an opportun for true ironi ? ? 'mayb even a littl bit of satir ? ? 'if the film work in a few more clich ? ? s . 
what put a damper on thi otherwis except and creativ film , i ? ? ? m afraid , is the end , or , rather , the ident of the killer . 
it doe the job , i guess , accomplish what it should , bring the three film full circl , but upon my first view it seem rather dissatisfi becaus it appear a littl too contriv , too arbitrari ; after a second view , which i endeavor upon due to thi recur disapprob , the killer ? ? ? s ident still seem a littl too random , but hi motiv came across more sound thi time around , and the eventu conclus wa ultim more satisfi . 
all in all , `` scream 3 `` doe not fall victim to the most lament principl of a trilog : it is not the worst of the film . 
as a trilog , `` scream `` wa a lot of fun ; refresh , humor , offbeat . 
almost sad to see it go . 
but then , it doe seem best to quit while you ? ? ? re ahead , and `` scream 3 `` doe a fine job of provid closur to it charact . 
for now , `` scream `` hold the titl as the finest seri of horror film to be commit to celluloid . 
not too shabbi .
