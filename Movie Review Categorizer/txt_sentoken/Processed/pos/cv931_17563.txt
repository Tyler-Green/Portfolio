like the great music piec of mozart himself , amadeu is a true work of art . 
it is one of those few movi of the 80 's that will be known for it class , it style , and it intellig . 
whi is thi such a good film ? 
there are almost too mani reason to explain . 
the stori : court compos salieri ( f . 
murray abraham ) feel wave of differ emot go through hi head as wolfgang amadeu mozart ( tom hulc ) come into hi life as the young geniu compos . 
salieri feel envi , and jealousi , but at the same time is fascin with mozart 's brillianc and ingeni . 
we travel through mozart 's life as a compos , through hi struggl , hi triumph , and ultim , hi demis . 
the act : abraham is magnifici as salieri ; hi act rang enabl him to focu on each individu emot and express it through hi speech and bodi languag . 
thi perform earn him a well deserv oscar . 
tom hulc is interest as well as mozart , a quirki , annoy bratti kid with an annoy laugh . 
he 's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aid by hi wife ( elizabeth berridg ) , who is good in her role , but lack dramat depth . 
jeffrey jone , in a smaller , more dignifi role than such role in stay tune and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectli becaus of hi nobl charm . 
the movi : everi element of thi movi work . 
the costum and makeup are veri memor , as well as it stun art direct , and unforgett score ( adapt from mozart 's origin music ) . 
while wolfgang amadeu mozart wa a geniu at music , milo forman prove with hi film that he is a geniu of filmmak . 
thi movi is a classic that will be rememb for year to come .
