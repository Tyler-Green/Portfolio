tunney , display an act rang not hint at in the teenag witch thriller the craft , deliv an astonish perform that won her the best actress prize at last year 's venic film festiv . 
to term her work a tour-de-forc is not to impli that she attack the sceneri ; tunney 's effect lie in her modul and vulner , which make her depict of marci 's ill -- which often caus her to act violent -- that much more convinc and tragic . 
she and the nice subtl thoma develop a sweetli innoc and beguilingli off-kilt chemistri .
