it is often said by hi fan that hal hartley movi are an acquir tast . 
inde . 
while perhap less danger than tequila shooter or bungee-jump , they requir no less amount of physic stamina and concentr . 
i felt reward at the end of henri fool ; thi movi creep up on you-at a slow 139 minut , i mean creeps-and despit the final shot 's ambigu , i left complet satisfi . 
henri fool ( `` use to have an ? e ' `` ) arriv at garbageman simon grim 's hous , claim the vacant basement apart , and almost instantli inspir simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henri ( martin donovan look-alik ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who ha been `` exil and margin `` by the publish commun becaus of hi crimin activ . 
simon 's poetri turn him into a local sensat , as it caus mute women to sing , high-school girl to swoon , and councilmen to rile against it `` pornograph `` content . 
meanwhil , henri seduc both simon 's depend mother ( porter ) and immatur sister ( sundanc queen posey ) with philosoph babbl ( which is by turn brilliant and inan ) and breathi anim lust . 
these stori element result in climax both inevit and unpredict ; the teacher-stud relationship form between henri and simon eventu revers itself . 
henri fool is sprinkl with hartley-ian flourish : simon drink milk from `` udderley 's `` ; the big teen hang-out is call `` world of donut `` ; simon wear hi garbageman 's uniform throughout ; the edit style is decidedli ellipt . . . 
( which is key to the conclus 's said ambigu ) . 
the perform by the three lead are abras at first , self-consci `` quirki `` ; the introductori scene are a chore . 
these peopl do grow on you becaus they convey genuin passion , a belief in themselv , and becaus they have long-term goal ; henri and simon may drink a lot of budweis and hang out on the streetcorn , but they are n't pop slacker . 
the stori is rather classic : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , rais on book ; the timid tute ha innat talent hi master onli dream of . 
( shade of film school . . . ) 
the finish film is epic in it proport for a stori so small , and the final third doe test one 's patienc , yet henri fool is tight , hardli excess in it length . 
how refresh to see a movi thi long in 1998 devot entir to charact . 
and unless i nod off , not a singl build explod . 
thi , hartley 's seventh featur , is contempl about `` the artist `` ; fortun , we never get a sampl of simon 's work , and it 's a testament to the actor and the screenplay that by the end we can surmis what sort of thought would pour from these writer ' pen .
