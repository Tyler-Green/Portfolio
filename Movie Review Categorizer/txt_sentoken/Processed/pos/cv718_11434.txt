usual a movi is about someth more than a soil rug , but not the big lebowski . 
the new offer from the creator of 1996 's critic hit fargo , is to say the least , wildli entertain . 
origin ha alway been a strong trait in the coen brother 's movi , and the big lebowski is insan origin . 
it begin oddli enough when jeff `` the dude `` lebowski ( jeff bridg ) is mistaken for a millionair , jeff `` the big `` lebowski ( david huddleston ) , who 's wife , bunni ( tara reid ) owe money all over town . 
two goon , out to collect on bunni 's debt break into dude 's hous . 
they attempt to collect the money that bunni owe them and one of them urin on hi rug . 
the next day dude explain hi situat to hi bowl team ( steve buscemi & john goodman , respect . ) 
he is advis to go to the big lebowski and get him to pay for the defil rug . 
he doe thi , and shortli after get tie up in a kidnap caper . 
thi is a extrem funni movi with lot of belli laugh moment . 
the coen brother have assembl a great cast that play off each other perfectli . 
also sever great support role , john turturro as a child molest bowler name jesu . 
the coen 's script play off perfectli and it all goe togeth to make it extrem entertain . 
i doubt thi movi will be nearli as popular as fargo , but it off the wall moment make it so far the best of 1998 . 
if you like anyth els the coen brother have done you will love thi one , if not they give thi one a tri it a littl differ .
