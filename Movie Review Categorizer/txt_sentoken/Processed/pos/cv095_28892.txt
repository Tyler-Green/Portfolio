`` crazy/beauti `` suffer from the damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-do n't syndrom . 
after a spate of flighti , cookie-cutt teen film , the romant drama address alcohol and parent loss along with it love stori . 
but rather than applaud the product , earli review have dismiss it as an overblown `` afterschool special . `` 
even wors , in the wake of feder trade commiss hear that blast the industri for market violent and sexual movi to young peopl , the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebi and forc director john stockwel to re-shoot scene and cut footag to `` tone thing down . `` 
needless to say , the filmmak wa frustrat . 
`` we were tri to make a cautionari tale , `` he told newsweek , `` and we could n't show the behavior we were tri to caution peopl away from . `` 
regardless , the film work , thank to except perform from it lead player and a script determin to transcend stereotyp . 
`` crazy/beauti `` is qualiti fare , good enough that i half-expect the summer movi crap polic to walk into the press screen and confisc the print for `` failur to incorpor explos and poop joke . `` 
set in pacif palisad , calif . , the stori follow the burgeon relationship between two teen . 
everi morn and even , carlo nunez ( jay hernandez ) take a two-hour bu ride in order to attend pacif high school . 
an honor student and star athlet , carlo is respons , modest and focus as he work on secur a place in the naval academi . 
all is well until he meet nicol oakley ( kirsten dunst ) , the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) . 
nicol is a drunk appar hell-bent on self-destruct . 
carlo is smart enough to recogn the danger in get involv with her , but he is onli human and she ha the greatest smile . 
plu , as her father note , she ha a real knack for draw other into her downward spiral . 
as with `` save the last danc , `` `` crazy/beauti `` ( god , how i hate lower-cas titl ) take situat that look stale on paper and make them seem fresh . 
while note the racial and social differ between the kid , the screenplay danc around most of the clich ? s ( there are still sever mtv moment , though ) . 
the filmmak make a point to give charact that crucial extra bit of shade that turn them into individu instead of stereotyp and the actor take it from there . 
cute-as-a-button dunst forc the viewer to share the pain beneath nicol 's behavior . 
she is credibl enough that when dad urg carlo to get away from her befor she drag him down , i hope the boy would listen . 
as carlo , hernandez is a revel . 
hunki without look like the product of a hollywood design team , the young man can realli act ; we will see a lot of thi guy in the futur . 
asid from it titl , the biggest problem with `` crazy/beauti `` is it end , which wrap everyth up too fast and too tidi . 
after care present credibl charact and situat , the conclus feel rush and lazi . 
still , thi is the kind of film that deserv accolad from critic instead of cheap shot . 
`` afterschool special `` my ass ? `` crazy/beauti `` is the real deal .
