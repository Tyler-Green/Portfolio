it 's a curiou thing - i 've found that when willi is not call on to carri the whole movi , he 's much better and so is the movi . 
even though , in the sixth sens he is the `` name `` , he doe n't have the pivot role . 
that honour goe to haley osment who play cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghost . 
if osment wa cute or preciou , the director go for the maudlin , thi would be noth more than a movie-of-the-week , thank , osment is not onli better than that , but in some instanc , blow everyon els off the screen in a bravura perform . 
we get to see hi fear , vulner , strength and intellig which make the sixth sens one of the best movi i 've seen thi year . 
the whole cast match him in qualiti , with willi give a fairli low key perform that match the subject matter . 
one thing about thi movi , it target . 
thi is n't a sfxfest like the haunt or a gorefest , thi is more what i 'd call a supernatur drama , more interest in charact than in dazzl you with makeup . 
one caveat : there 's a love twist in the movi , someth like the usual suspect , where you end up replay the movi in your head rethink what you have just seen . 
i wa extrem lucki to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , befor ani hype or critic review were out , so i went in with no bias . 
if anyon want to talk to about the movi befor you see it , do n't let them . 
let the director explain on hi own pace and you 'll enjoy the movi vastli more .
