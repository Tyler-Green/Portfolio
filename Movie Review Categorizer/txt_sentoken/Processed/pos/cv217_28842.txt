susan granger 's review of `` big eden `` ( jour de fete ) 
it 's utopia , thi tini town tuck away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codger loung on the porch of the gener store to pass the time away and the local matchmak ( nan martin , louis fletcher ) eagerli pair off the young peopl , regardless of sexual prefer . 
there 's nari a homophob or bigot around , much to the surpris of henri hart ( ary gross ) , a success but lone manhattan artist who return home to care for sam ( georg coe ) , the ail grandfath who rais him . 
and with the simultan re-appear of hi best-friend from high-school and object of hi unrequit love ( tim dekay ) , now divorc with two young son , the fact of hi homosexu must be face . 
to complet the triangl , there 's the tall , taciturn nativ american ( eric schweig ) who own the gener store and lovingli yet secretli prepar gourmet meal for henri and sam . 
thi fabl about home and famili is a major debut for first-tim film-mak thoma bezucha ( a former design for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticul about mind detail , use ballad like `` welcom to my world `` and `` achin ' , breakin ' heart `` to set up the concept of our univers long to find a place in which we can love and be love . 
in the paradis of big eden , what you are doe n't matter as much as generos of spirit , respect and kind . 
sure , the plot 's implaus but it 's a good-natur fantasi so allow should be made . 
and rob sweeney 's photographi of glacier nation park is spectacular ! 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` big eden `` is a charm , quirki , off-beat 7 . 
it 's a heart-warm romant comedi about a gay man who doe n't die of aid or wind up alon at the end .
