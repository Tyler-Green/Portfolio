long review =========== 
i must admit be a bit reluct go into thi film . 
i did n't believ that they ( mike myer and dana carvey ) could hold it up for an hour and a half , i figur that perhap the first half-hour would be great , and the rest would be `` fluff . `` 
howev , i wa realli surpris about how well they were abl to keep the laugh go for the virtual the whole film , with the except of the end . 
( which i wo n't discuss for obviou reason , but it 's not * that * bad . ) 
stori : the plot wa quit thin , but it realli wa n't that notic , becaus of the rapid-fir joke that myer wrote in . 
alot of the joke are veri similar to hot shot ! , in be veri `` parodyish . `` 
( okay , bad term . ) 
extrem witti throughout , although ( as in hot shot ) it got a bit repetit in the middl . 
act : as in mani comedi , the act is n't realli * that * import . 
howev , myer turn in a good perform as wayn , play the charact perfectli , ( although i still like him better back on much music , in a more `` canadian `` type of mode . ) 
carvey is okay as garth , but he lack the spark myer put into wayn . 
tia carrer is mediocr as cassandra , play it veri stilt . 
low is fine as ben oliv , but is noth to write home about . 
without a doubt , thi movi is mike myer all the way . 
direct : spheeri is a classic `` music `` movi director , make dude , and declin of western civil ii -- the metal year . 
( she also direct the boy next door , which is differ , to say the least . ) 
she is veri capabl , know how direct a comedi , the correct camera movement it instil laugh , etc . one of the better job i can rememb for a comedi . 
overal : i would suggest to anyon that like snl 's skit to go see thi film in the theatr . 
howev , my person opinion , as in most comedi , is that they work just as well on video . 
you defin have to be fan of music , and all form of media in gener to enjoy thi film . 
without a doubt , thi is the best comedi so far thi year . 
it 'll make ton ' o ' dough for everyon involv . 
let 's just hope they make a thousand sequel . 
[ sorri , i had to get the lame joke in . . . 
forgiv me . ]
