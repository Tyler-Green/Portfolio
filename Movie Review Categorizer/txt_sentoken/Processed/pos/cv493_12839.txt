one of kyle mclachlan 's earlier cinemat featur , thi movi ha had an obviou influenc on such film as the termin ( 8/10 ) , speci ( 7/10 ) and the more recent , fallen with denzel washington . 
plot : a science-fict pictur set in modern time , thi thriller follow the exploit of an `` entiti `` from outer space , who like to inhabit human bodi , use them up until they are complet worn out , and then switch over to the next avail receptacl . 
fbi agent ( mclachlan ) and local top cop ( nouri ) are charg with the captur of thi `` thing `` befor it 's too late . 
critiqu : thi fast-pac , urban equival of the thing ( 8/10 ) , check in on all cylind for ultra-viol ( god know how mani peopl die in thi movi ) , action and an overal rock ' n roll attitud . 
then again , how can you go wrong with an `` alien `` that like the ferrari , gun , heavi metal music and sexi girl ? ! 
grant , the plot is n't the most elabor of tale ( alien bad , find alien , kill alien ) , but i can honestli say that i wa never onc bore dure the view of thi entir pictur . 
i would n't recommend it to those who do n't like car chase , murder , and bland act , but for all the rest of you out there , those who enjoy put away their brain everi now and again , sit back , slam back some salsa 'd nacho , and relish in the cheez some call film . . . 
have a blast ! ! 
two scene to watch for are both within the first ten minut of thi gore-fest . 
the open sequenc is one of the most rockin ' scene to open ani action movi , and the subsequ extra-terrestri `` transform `` is anoth eye-catch . 
even the late 80 's special effect were okay . 
follow by the hidden ii in 1994 . 
littl known fact : thi film wa kyle maclachlan 's first non-david lynch foray into the world of featur film . 
hi first two movi appear were in lynch 's wretch dune ( 4/10 ) and the sensat blue velvet ( 8 . 5/10 )
