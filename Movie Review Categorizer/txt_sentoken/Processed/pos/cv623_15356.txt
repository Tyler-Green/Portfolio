i feel no hesit in say that `` there 's someth about mari `` is the best film that i will see all year . 
from the moment the credit start to roll at the end of the pictur , there wa no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiec that will remain unsurpass in the remain month of 1998 . 
it is that good of a film . 
when gene siskel said thi about `` fargo `` onli a few month into '96 , i dismiss the notion as ridicul . 
how could you possibl know that a film is so great that noth you could possibl see in the futur could beat it ? 
but after see the farrelli 's hilari and surprisingli heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel wa talk about . 
onc in a ( veri great ) while , a film come along that is so dare , so brilliant and simpli so enjoy that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . 
and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienc someth veri special . 
now for the shocker ; `` mari `` is the grossest and most disgust film i have ever view ( `` pink flamingo `` obvious notwithstand ) . 
the movi is so rude and , i guess , inappropri in natur that i had a hard time sit in a theater watch it with my parent ( luckili i had seen it befor them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . 
forget `` blaze saddl `` , `` anim hous `` and even the former king of gross-out comedi , `` monti python 's mean of life `` ; they were all onli prelud to the farrelli 's assault on the sens . 
in fact , thi may even be the funniest film i 've ever had the pleasur of see ( the onli real contend is `` monti python and the holi grail `` ) , and most certainli the most hilari to come out all decad . 
but as funni as it is , someth also ha to be said about the overal sweet of `` mari `` ; it ha a huge heart . 
you see , the farrelli 's are truli gift filmmak . 
they do n't just present you with a string of dick and fart joke ( although there are plenti to go around ) . 
they also , veri wise , add an unbeliev amount of charisma to the main charact and actual have them develop as the stori progress . 
it 's funni , though . 
if you just look at an outlin of the stori , it seem kind of contriv and predict . 
but believ me , it is anyth but . 
ben stiller play ted , a veri shi and clumsi teenag geek who lust after the school babe , mari ( cameron diaz ) . 
after he stick up for her retard brother , warren ( w . 
earli brown - the cameraman , believ it or not , from `` scream `` ) , hi dream come true when she invit him to the prom . 
in one of the film 's funniest scene , someth goe wrong ( i wo n't ruin it for those who know noth about the film ) and ted is unabl to face mari ever again . 
jump to the present . 
after year of self-loath , ted final hire privat detect pat heali ( a suitabl slimi matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chanc at win the woman he ha love sinc high school . 
heali find that mari is still a full-blown hotti and decid to tri and keep her for himself . 
admittingli , the basic stori line leav a littl to be desir . 
after all , with a not-really-all-that-funni premis , how can you sustain laughter for nearli two hour ? 
somehow , the farrelli 's pull it off . 
the perform here are also right on target . 
as ted , stiller add just the right amount of clumsi charm to make hi charact not irrit , as he would normal be , but veri lovabl . 
and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obviou reason , but the actor who realli grab your attent is w . earl brown as mari 's brother . 
no other actor ha even come close to play a mental retard man with as much natur eas as brown display here . 
i know he wo n't be nomin , but thi is the guy who should not be count out when it come time to hand out the oscar nod in februari . 
as good as the actor are , though , it 's the director ' movi all the way . 
i guarante that on almost everi other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupi by steven spielberg 's wwii epic `` save privat ryan `` . 
and ye , that is a great film worthi of the recognit it ha been get . 
but which is harder ; make a great war film or have your audienc laugh so hard that they ca n't breath for minut at a time ? 
i 'll let you decid that one for yourself , but thi critic is stick to hi gun . 
there is just someth about `` mari `` .
