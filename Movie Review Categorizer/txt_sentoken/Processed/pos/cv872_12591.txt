robert redford is veri good at play charact who have incred , god-given gift , but are abl to act like ordinari peopl . 
in `` the natur `` ( 1984 ) , he play the fallen angel charact of roy hobb , the basebal player who wa destin to be `` the best there ever wa , `` but still act like a humbl farm boy . 
in `` butch cassidi and the sundanc kid `` ( 1969 ) , he wa the most danger shot in the west , yet he came off like a noth more than a boyishli good-look charmer . 
even in `` indec propos `` ( 1993 ) , where he play a man who wa so good at make money that he believ he could buy love , redford wa still abl to exud an aura of shi decenc , especi when recit a tale of lost love . 
in hi latest film , `` the hors whisper , `` base on the best-sel novel by nichola evan , redford again play such a charact . 
redford also direct the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movi - i suppos the charact of tom booker , a man who ha the amaz gift of understand and somehow commun with hors , wa just too good to pass up . 
despit hi enorm and rare gift when it come to train troubl hors ( a magazin articl coin the phrase `` hors whisper `` to describ hi uncanni talent ) , booker see himself as an everyday cattl rancher whose greatest fear is grow old and no longer have a purpos in life . 
booker 's talent are tax into servic by anni maclean ( kristin scott thoma ) , a new york magazin editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , wa recent in a horribl accid . 
the accid , which is film with gut-wrench horror , happen when grace and her best friend are out ride hors - an eighteen-wheel kill grace 's friend , sever wound and traumat grace 's hors , pilgrim , and caus grace to lose part of her right leg . 
anni believ that if pilgrim can be heal , grace will be heal as well , which lead her to booker . 
at first , she tri to get booker to come to new york to see the hors , but that doe n't work . 
instead , she pack up grace and pilgrim , leav her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and head for the roll hill of montana where booker run a ranch with hi brother , frank ( chri cooper ) , and hi sister-in-law , dian ( diann wiest ) . 
in mani way , the film is like a journey , both liter and symbol . 
the move out west ha alway been a great american tradit of renew , and it 's hard not to see anni and grace 's leav manhattan for montana as a variat on the classic theme of citi vs . countri . 
in `` the hors whisper , `` countri is clearli the victor . 
the citi is character by claustrophobia and unhappi , and it is not until the charact arriv in the wide-open space of montana that grace 's anger at be physic and emot crippl begin to dissip , anni 's control natur begin to relax , and pilgrim onc again learn to trust peopl . 
redford is just as in love with the grand montana countri in thi film as he wa when he direct `` a river run through it `` six year ago . 
in mani way , `` the hors whisper `` come from the same poetic vein as `` river , `` and the movi could probabl be a good fifteen minut shorter if redford had decid to spend less camera-tim on the grass and mountain . 
but then , that would ruin the magic . 
much of the film 's photographi is truli eleg , and it creat a palpabl sens of the sheer expans of the land . 
to further emphas thi , redford and cinematograph robert richardson ( `` natur born killer , `` `` platoon `` ) cheat a bit by shoot the begin of the film - which take place in new york - with mostli cold , harsh bluish filter and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shift to montana , richardson switch to soft-focu and natur light , and the screen widen to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio . 
in term of the stori itself , `` the hors whisper `` give us the same romantic view of adulteri found in david lean 's `` a brief encount `` ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood 's 1995 adapt of robert jame waller 's `` the bridg of madison counti `` ( richard lagravenes , co-screenwrit here also adapt `` bridg `` ) . 
although `` the hors whisper `` ha a strong romant sensibl , i still find someth oddli troubl about thi kind of stori . 
it seem to me that there should be some sympathi for the husband who 's be left behind for thi brief , heart-sweep affair , but there rare is . 
in `` the hors whisper , `` the thankless role of be the fuddy-duddi husband fall to sam neill . 
he play the charact as a decent , hard-work man who is a good husband and father ; hi onli failur is that he love hi wife more than she love him . 
he is at risk of lose anni to booker not becaus he did anyth to drive her away , but simpli becaus he happen to be a normal , fairli uninspir man . 
there is one scene that is particularli tell of how the movi feel about each charact . 
it show booker and robert go into a hors pen - booker is dress like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert look somewhat frumpi and out-of-plac in a basebal cap . 
as they enter the pen , booker assuredli swing over the fenc , while robert hesit , then open the gate and , in a goofi moment , forget to close it behind him . 
it 's a small scene , but it clearli demonstr the movi 's thorough love of the booker charact for hi romant rough . 
after all , booker repres everyth good about the citi while robert repres everyth banal and unnatur about it . 
the best scene in `` the hors whisper `` tend to involv not the build romanc between booker and anni , but rather the heal process of grace and her hors . 
although booker 's horse-train method are mythic and unrealist , the scene with him and pilgrim are strang mesmer . 
these are parallel by the scene between him and grace , some of which are humor , and all of which are tender and true . 
at some point , i wish the movi would drop the whole romanc angl and focu on grace more . 
nevertheless , redford is obvious a romant at heart , and he bring a light touch to the erot moment in the film . 
there are no dramat sex scene , but there is a move scene when he and scott thoma are slow-danc , alway move ever closer togeth , that is far more erot than ani scene of sweati bodi grind togeth . 
although the movi is longer than it should be and is essenti a melodramat tearjerk with an unsatisfi conclus that guarante unhappi for just about everi charact , there are enough moment like that which make `` the hors whisper `` worth the price of admiss .
