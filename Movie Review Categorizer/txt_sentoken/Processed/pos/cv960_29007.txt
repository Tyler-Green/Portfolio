gordon fleme ( peter mullan ) is in a bind . 
he ha a new , unexpect babi and hi busi , hazard materi remov , is in danger of go under . 
when he and hi crew get a job opportun at the long-abandon danver state hospit , he underbid the competit to secur the contract and promis to get the three-week job done in one . 
it will prove to be a fate week for them all in `` session 9 . `` 
gordo get the job to remov asbesto and other hazard materi from the spooki old mental hospit in prepar for reloc town offic there . 
their guid tour of the facil by a local offici , bill gigg ( paul guilfoyl ) , bring them through some of the creepier part of the former asylum . 
but , a job is a job and , if they finish in a week , as promis , there is a $ 10000 bonu in store . 
as they get down to their work , thing , normal and not so normal , begin to happen . 
gordon hear a disembodi voic beckon him . 
phil ( david caruso ) is conflict work with a guy , hank ( josh luca ) , who is see hi old girlfriend . 
mike ( co-screenwrit steven gevedon ) ha discov a cach of audiotap and transcript from old psychiatr session ( henc , the titl ) with inmat mari hobb , a multi-person patient with a dark secret . 
gordo 's nephew , jeff ( brendan sexton iii ) , suffer from night phobia and is afraid to ventur into the dark bowel of the hospit . 
as the agre upon week draw to an end , hank mysteri disappear from the workplac after a nocturn confront with someon ( someth ? ) in the hospit . 
tension mount and distrust build among the rest as they watch their chanc for the bonu start to slip away . 
but , there is more , much more , at stake as the hospit and it histori of insan weigh on them all . 
i do n't want to give away too much of the stori of `` session 9 , `` so i 'll stop there . 
what we have here is a spooki horror flick that use none of the jump-out-at-you-from-the-dark cheap shot that have becom part and parcel with horror film sinc the advent of `` halloween `` and `` friday the thirteenth . `` 
there is no cat leap out of the dark or the shock of suddenli see oneself in a strateg place mirror . 
with the except of one shadowi and chill imag at one point spooki interlud in the film , there is littl that you can get your arm around as far as what , specif , is `` frighten . `` 
as i watch `` session 9 `` i becam awar of the subtl thing that built up dure the stori that make it a true horror movi . 
the strike high-definit video camera work by uta briesewitz ( who work with the director , brad anderson , on hi `` next stop wonderland `` ) help to build up tension with close-up , fluid camera movement and odd angl in a way that would make alfr hitchcock proud . 
music , too , is use to intens effect , join with the camera to make simpl scene frighten , even horrifi . 
coupl these tech feat with an intellig stori that use element of `` the shine , `` `` the blair witch project `` and , even `` the texa chainsaw massacr `` and you get a decent , intrigu horror flick . 
addit , the brilliant decis to shoot at danver state hospit give the film anoth star charact , the institut itself , which lend even more chill to the equat . 
act is anoth factor that rais `` session 9 `` abov the usual dreck present in recent horror hit like `` scream , `` `` i know what you did last summer `` and their sequel . 
those film took good-look , though gener , young actor and actress and put them to use to build up a bodi count , substitut mayhem for real horror . 
anderson opt , instead , to use matur , experienc actor like peter mullan and david caruso to fill hi charact ' shoe and the differ in cast qualiti is notabl . 
mullan , in particular , put an arc on hi charact , gordon , as the troubl guy who slowli and inexor fall under the pressur of famili , job and , final , danver state hospit . 
the rest of the small cast fit the bill as peopl , not just fodder for the mayhem . 
david caruso , as gordo 's senior man and near equal in the busi , show just how good an actor he is . 
he made the jump from tv 's `` nypd blue `` to film far too soon and hi decis in the role he took ( i 'll never forget the horrend `` jade `` ) were less than star make . 
he roll hi sleev up and doe the job well here . 
gevedon , luca and sexton are more than fodder , too . 
the onli problem with `` session 9 `` lay in the uninspir end . 
it take on a fairli convent final that cover old ground and is a bit of a disappoint after the terrif ( and inspir ) build up . 
the pleasur is get there and i wish that anderson and gevedon had kept up the steam they had so abli built dure the bulk of the film 
`` session 9 `` is an unusu feat . 
it is scari , doe n't use cheap trick and rais goos bump with it intellig render , subtl horror . 
becaus of the local interest of danver , it should do well with the northeast crowd . 
i hope it get the nation distribut it deserv . 
i give it a b+ .
