plot : a human space astronaut accident fall upon a planet rule by ape . 
he is taken prison along with some other human , and tri hi best to escap hi simian captor . 
oh yeah , and did i mention that the ape can talk ? 
kewl ! 
critiqu : despit thi film not look like a `` tim burton movi `` or it lead human charact show ani sign of be a human be himself , i did find myself gener entertain throughout most of thi film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . 
although the thing that set thi movi apart from all other is definit it incred ape make-up job and character . 
i mean , i wa complet convinc that everi singl one of these ape wa for real ! 
i also have to `` give it up `` to all of the actor insid the costum , not onli for wake up at three in the morn everi day to get make-up slobber all over them for 2-4 hour , but for come through their costum exterior and sell us their charact on the screen as well . 
i especi enjoy bonham carter 's perform , who i believ to be the most develop charact in the entir film ( human or ape ) and tim roth 's bad guy , who chew up sceneri and ooz evil in everi scene in which he took part . 
plot-wis , i like the begin of the film , the whole build-up onc wahlberg got into the villag , the escap and most of the fight scene , but onc thing got out into the desert area ( and the final battl sequenc ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . 
i wa much more intrigu by the interact between the charact and the whole idea of `` human be as anim `` then i wa about the end battl sequenc , which just seem a bit too typic for thi kind of film . 
i also hate the `` kid `` charact who just got on my nerv and did n't realli care for the way that the battl sequenc wa resolv ( i wo n't ruin it here but c'mon guy . . . you 
coulda thought of someth a littl more plausibl than that , no ? ) . 
but the thing that held thi movi back more than anyth els wa it lead charact , hi cold demeanor and the zero chemistri that he share with either one of hi inter-speci love interest . 
thi dude did n't seem to give a rat 's ass about anyon but himself and i ultim did n't realli care about what happen to him either . 
now i 'm not sure if thi wa the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffer becaus of it . 
visual , the movi wa also nice to look at ( especi the ape ! ) , but i definit expect greater cool from tim burton . 
the `` surpris end `` that highlight the origin planet of the ape film back in 1968 , felt a littl tack on here , and despit be interest , did n't realli make all that much sens to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . 
so overal , i love the whole `` feel `` of the planet , the ape that rule it , the manner in which they treat the human , scream , shout and revert the entir evolut chain , but did n't appreci the film 's lack of human charact develop ( whi wa kri kristofferson even in thi movi ? ) and the fact that it lead male and femal human were just plain bore . 
but i would still recommend thi film as a fun , summer movi with laugh , creepi and a realli cool premis . 
ps : for anyon who ha seen the origin , i can not believ that they did n't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human charact ( in thi case , mark wahlberg ) goe nut at the world in which he 's suddenli been thrust ( `` thi is a mad hous ! `` - 
type of thing ) . 
the guy in thi film bare seem to be `` put off `` by the fact that he 's surround by ape who can speak english ! ! 
where 's joblo come from ? 
the arriv ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mar ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the ape ( 9/10 ) - sleepi hollow ( 8/10 )
