a big surpris to me . 
the good trailer had hint that they pull the imposs off , but make a blue brother movi without jake blue ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i realli had no hope . 
they replac him just fine . 
not with john goodman , he did n't do much of anyth , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can realli sing . 
the fourth blue brother is j evan bonif , who 's ten . 
thi wa anoth of my fear for the film , but he 's a realli good dancer , and play a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dub ) . 
thing that intellectu had bother me befor , like no mission from god , everyon be richer , it not be film in chicago -- gave me no problem at all . 
i 'm quit pleas that there were less car pile-up , becaus they meant less music , and john landi seem to have lost interest in the whole thing . 
there 's a few earli crash , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stop . 
it 's just the music . 
one of my problem with the first is that cab calloway 's song is so good the actual blue brother look dull after him , but there 's no problem with thi . 
the music is all as good as ever , ton of great musician show up -- with the except of johnni lang , who ca n't sing , all the musician do a great job . 
the onli real problem i had wa the special effect . 
these were superflu and a wast of money . 
sinc the film is n't do veri well , they could mean we have no possibl of anoth sequel , which i want to see . 
the bluegrass version of rider in the sky is even better than rawhid .
