i know that `` funnest `` is n't a word . 
`` fun `` is a noun , and therefor can not be conjug like an adject . 
but that 's the word that came to me right after view `` chicken run . `` 
no wonder : thi is the kind of movi that reduc you to childish express , like `` that wa the funnest movi i 've ever seen ! `` 
so to hell with webster 's -- `` chicken run `` is one of the funnest movi i 've seen in a while . 
i ca n't rememb the last time i 've seen anyth funner . 
the chicken at tweedi 's farm are up to someth . 
live in a concentr camp-lik atmospher , they are led by one plucki hen call ginger ( voic of julia sawalha ) who continu come up with plan for escap -- and alway get caught , subsequ spend day after day in the coal box . 
one night , a brash american rooster fli in over the fenc , call himself rocki ( mel gibson ) , famou fli rooster and circu perform . 
rocki promis to teach the chicken how to fli , and the situat grow more desper as the nefari mr . tweedi ( miranda richardson ) decid to abandon the farm 's egg-sel plan for a pie-sel plan . 
she order a huge pie-mak machin , cackl , `` chicken go in ; pie come out . `` 
what sort of pie ? 
chicken pie , of cours . 
co-director nick park and hi studio , aardman anim , produc three oscar-win short film : `` creatur comfort , `` `` the wrong trouser , `` and `` a close shave . `` 
the latter two were the second and third instal of a trilog star the delight team wallac & gromit , a man and hi dog famou for get themselv into increasingli peculiar adventur . 
part of what made the `` wallac `` film brilliantli entertain wa park 's uncanni abil to make an old stori seem new . 
`` the wrong trouser , `` for exampl , pull out a lot of old hitchcockian suspens trick , and `` a close shave `` owe a great deal of inspir to classic detect stori . 
but in the hand of park and hi team , the stori felt fresh and inspir , and not the least bit contriv . 
now team with co-director peter lord , park ha creat a similar creatur in `` chicken run . `` 
the plot is larg lift from `` the great escap `` ( watch for a quick refer to the ball-bounc scene ) , with some spielberg-inspir action sequenc provid the excit . 
thing is , the film doe n't feel like it 's been lift from somewher els ; `` chicken run `` feel fresh , aliv , like noth els ever done . 
part of it is the origin idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movi star chicken ? 
park and lord milk the incongru for all it 's worth : the charact treat their situat as if it were dead seriou , and to them , it is . 
but they 're * chicken * , so it 's funni to us . 
anoth thing that help `` chicken run `` ( and most of park 's film ) succeed is the anim ' subtl way of give nod to the veri film they 're crib . 
there are refer to `` the great escap , `` obvious , and `` stalag 17 . `` 
the chase sequenc insid the chicken grinder parodi both `` raider of the lost ark `` and `` indiana jone and the templ of doom . `` 
there 's even a nod to `` the blue brother , `` if you can believ it , and the filmmak even get in a littl light-heart rib at the expens of their star voic actor , take a coupl of veri subtl jab at mel gibson 's nation and film histori . 
the `` braveheart `` refer is a hoot if you catch it . 
when you consid just how fine a line resid between a funni parodi and a redund one , `` chicken run `` is downright brilliant in it execut . 
consid thi : sinc juli of last year , i 've seen dozen upon dozen of `` blair witch project `` parodi , on televis , on the radio , and onlin . 
out of all those , mayb one or two were amus , the rest tiresom . 
whi ? 
becaus onc you got past the thought that `` they 're parodi that & # 8216 ; blair witch ' movi , `` most of the parodi had noth to offer -- no insight , no origin idea , no greater purpos . 
they were onli funni if you had seen the movi ; otherwis , you got noth . 
convers , `` chicken run `` doe n't lean on it parodi -- the film refer are never the sole focu of ani scene . 
if you 've never seen `` indiana jone , `` the chase sequenc is still fun . 
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocki remain an interest charact . 
park , lord , and screenwrit karey kirkpatrick realiz that an audienc doe not need a parodi shove in their face befor it 's understood , and as a result , `` chicken run `` is fill with visual and verbal jab that are never too obviou , but not quit vagu either . 
enjoy of thi movi doe n't requir knowledg of film histori , but if you 've got it , `` chicken run `` is that much richer . 
the voic cast turn in uniformli live perform , and the charact they play are given so mani subtl nuanc that it 's hard not to fall in love with everi one of them . 
ginger is perfect , spunki and opinion , but with a soft heart that forbid her to leav her companion behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousi girl on `` absolut fabul `` ) nail it . 
she ha warm , human chemistri with gibson , whose rocki hide hi person doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . 
the charact ' inevit romanc doe n't feel contriv , but sweet . 
poor mr . tweedi ( toni haygarth ) suspect the chicken are organ in some way , but hi limit intellect prevent him from figur thing out , and hi overbear wife certainli is n't ani help . 
jane horrock deliv a love voic character as tragic optimist bab ( a hen that run away with most of the best one-lin , all while perpetu crochet a sweater ) , and two supply-trad rat that seem to have walk straight out of a monti python sketch nearli steal the show dure the live central swing-danc sequenc . 
they even come up with an inspir riff on someth that 's baffl scholar and theologian alik for decad : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . 
one might have expect thi inevit joke to come off as wearisom , but as with most of `` chicken run , `` it come as a delight surpris . 
the film manag to cross all barrier ; it should be access to both children and adult , brit and yank , rat and chicken . 
the anim is first-rat . 
rememb that thi wa all done the old-fashion way , with actual human move clay figurin around on a tini set bit by painstak bit , and you see just how truli remark `` chicken run `` realli is . 
thi movi possess that same qualiti that make pixar studio ' anim great : precis and unwav attent to detail . 
as in such top-notch famili fare as `` a bug 's life `` or `` toy stori 2 , `` `` chicken run `` ha someth to offer in nearli everi frame . 
certainli a passiv viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward stori with a worthwhil moral and some surprisingli touch scene , but a activ , attent viewer will enjoy it even more becaus they 'll catch all the detail . 
anyway , the movi 's just a boatload of fun . 
funnest damn movi i 've seen all year .
