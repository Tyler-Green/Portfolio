i know it alreadi open in decemb , but i final got around to see rushmor last weekend , and it wa one of those rare oppritunit that i got to leav the theatr feel proud about pay the expens ticket price . 
as the final scene close out in happi slow-mo fashion , i felt happi to have been priveleg enough to watch such a good display of filmmak . 
jason schwartzman , hi face oddli intrigu behind those larg brace and glass , steal the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmor academi student who get terribl grade , but compens for it by organ most of the school 's club and organ ( i . e . 
the fenc team and write and produc school play ) and often pull outrag stunt , one that eventu earn him an expuls . 
thi stunt , build an aquarium on the school 's basebal diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widow elementari teacher rosemari cross ( olivia william ) . 
he fund thi aquarium with the help of millionar herman blume ( a veri oscarworthi bill murray ) , who eventu find himself fall in love with miss cross . 
rosemari and herman begin dating-and the fun begin ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battl for miss cross . 
herman manag to destroy max 's bike , while max cut herman 's brake , and it goe on like thi . 
but eventu max realiz he is too young for miss cross , and he ca n't stand in the way of two peopl in love . 
the academi of art & scienc realli mess up thi year ; they complet overlook rushmor ( and , if you ask me , it wa n't an accid ) . 
it mayb wa n't best pictur materi , but it certainli deserv a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray 's absens from the ballot is a complet snub . 
the entir mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it 's fun , and the next scene can turn seriou and dramat . 
the cinematographi give the movi an import feel , as well . 
i hope rushmor can overcom it ' oscar snub , and be enjoy by intellig film goer .
