when quentin tarantino made `` pulp fiction `` , he wa not onli make the greatest film of the 90 ; he wa also make what i believ to be the most influenti movi of all time . 
but befor you send me hate-mail for not give that titl to `` citizen kane `` , hear me out . 
much like `` citizen kane `` , `` pulp fiction `` ha chang movi make forev . 
but i think the latter ha had a tad more impact . 
`` pulp fiction `` ha actual usher in a new era of film make . 
it ha alter the way film will be view . 
`` fiction `` ha spawn so mani imit , i 've lost count . 
sure , some have been excel ( `` bound `` and `` the usual suspect `` spring immedi to mind ) , but ani seriou movie-go recogn `` pulp fiction `` as the origin neo-noir of the 90 . 
in thi review , i hope to chang all the peopl 's mind who have critic it for it 's excess profan and violenc ( which , by the way , is n't realli that graphic ) . 
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino 's masterpiec is the screenplay . 
it is fill with so much classic dialogu ( the `` quarter pounder with chees `` speech will go down in histori ) , it should be requir read for ani film student , if it is n't alreadi . 
the stori ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) center around three main episod , all of which eventu intertwin . 
the first , titl `` vincent vega and marcellu wallac 's wife `` , deal with a veri load john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequenc ) take mia wallac ( a star-mak perform by uma thurman ) , hi boss wife , out on a date to a cool 50 restaur call jack rabbit slim 's . 
they talk for a while ( with the occasion `` uncomfort silenc `` ) , mostli about a guy call toni rocki horror . 
after give marcellu ' new bride a foot massag , he wa thrown off a build and into a greenhous , give him a `` speech impedi `` . 
they also partak in a cool danc contest and end up twist to the chuck berri classic `` you never can tell `` . 
i wo n't reveal the rest of the stori , but i 'll definit say that it turn out to be a real bummer of a night , despit the cool trophi they win . 
the second stori ( the least of the three but still four star ) star bruce willi ( prove he can play someon other than john mcclain in the `` die hard `` flick ) as boxer butch coolidg . 
previous in the film ( like i said , it 's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellu wallac that he would take a fall in a match . 
as it turn out , he not onli doe n't take the fall , but he end up actual kill hi oppon . 
he take a cab to hi half-wit girlfriend 's apart , and to make a long stori short , end up go back to hi own place to retriev a gold watch , sort of a famili heirloom explain by christoph walken in a hilari flash-back sequenc . 
on hi way home , he bump into ( liter ) marcellu . 
the two wind up prison to two hillbilli sex murder , which result in the infam `` gimp `` scene , which is veri reminic of the `` squeal like a pig ! `` 
scene from `` deliver `` . 
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episod featur john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best perform of ani support actor ever ) as two slightli off-kilt hitmen tri to rid themselv of a bloodi car . 
they seek help with a friend of jackson 's ( play by the q-man himself ) , desper in need of a stress ball . 
they end up call a `` cleaner `` of sort , play by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . 
in the end , the stori brilliantli loop around itself , actual end where it began . 
if you have n't alreadi seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copi of the letterbox collector edit . 
it featur two previous unreleas scene and the origin film restor how it wa origin meant to be seen . 
earlier today , i bought thi version and watch it a few hour ago . 
what the pan-and-scan did to thi movi is inexcus . 
that version cut out , like , half the movi . 
what i have miss in the past year of view thi flick is amaz . 
for instanc , when travolta and jackson are in the apart near the end , the widescreen version allow you to see that sever thing on the wall make cross . 
thi might help explain the divin intervent that take place . 
just a theori . . . 
one of the thing that piss peopl off so much about thi movi is that tarantino borrow alot of scene from other movi ( i . e . 
`` psycho `` `` kiss me deadli `` , `` deliver `` , etc . ) . 
but whi should n't he ? 
it 's not like he out-right and blatantli stole . 
give the guy a break . 
in case you have n't alreadi notic , i believ `` pulp fiction `` is a suprem excel film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such great as `` casablanca `` and `` the godfath `` ) . 
trust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90 . 
and besid , it 's one hell of a ride . 
note : if anyon know how i could get a `` bad motherfuck `` wallet , pleas e-mail me . 
ani help would be greatli appreci .
