one of the more unusu and suggest violent film ever made , `` se7en `` is just a few step away from brillianc . 
howev , those few step away are onli a few step from a level of evil and deprav that few peopl want to discuss . 
the film receiv mix review upon releas , but there 's an underli sinist appeal and intrigu to thi that mani critic perhap did not notic . 
at time it get preachi about the horror it seem to be critic , but the script and the ultim pay-off are excel . 
the shock conclus is just as unpredict as the end of most film are predict . 
thi piec of work is 100 % intens . 
it 's uncomfort to watch , yet compel . 
`` i want not to look , yet i can not turn away . `` 
the stori creep along slowli and deliber , craft by visionari director david fincher . 
he ha experi in tantal hi audienc with inform and vision , but not give away too much too soon . 
thi is the guy who direct the omin `` alien 3 `` . 
`` se7en `` is even more omin becaus the threat is real . 
it 's human and , while the script take some artist licenc , the way in which the diabol killer work here is actual realist . 
that is , if a human be could be so intellig , patient , wealthi , and disillus . 
after the most bizarr open credit i 've ever seen ( refreshingli differ in edit style and music accompani ) , the initi charact develop take place . 
morgan freeman star as detect william somerset , a knowledg veteran who is readi to give up on hi job and the sick of societi . 
brad pitt co-star as detect david mill , the young hotshot who is brand new to thi unnam citi and full of furi to catch the bad guy . 
these two fine actor give the film it human qualiti ( along with the appeal gwyneth paltrow , who play traci , mill ' wife ) . 
howev , none of them stand out abov the materi . 
no disrespect intend , but two other actor could have play these part and the film probabl would have been about the same . 
an iron note is that somerset ha onli a week ( or 7 , that 's seven , day ) left on the forc to train hi young proteg . 
the titl of the pictur also refer to the 7 deadli sin , as chronicl by john milton in `` paradis lost `` -- gluttoni , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envi , & wrath . 
incident , i wrote the sin in order of how each victim wa found . 
it 's the last two sin that are the most intrigu and shock , but i wo n't give that away . 
as i said , thi ha a great end and no one should spoil it . 
anyway , the brilliant killer set out to make a statement to the world that these sin will no longer be toler and he make the `` sinner `` suffer for it . 
the two partner stumbl over the corps of a grotesqu obes man . 
they learn that he wa murder -- forc to eat himself to death . 
the killer leav small clue at thi and other murder and , of cours , somerset and mill are smart enough to stay with him all the way . 
if they did n't , it would be one short movi ! 
the deliber pace allow for craftsmanship of detail and stori . 
we see a lot of blood , but it 's not especi violent . 
the suggest of what happen is far more disgust than anyth actual shown -- like most of the violenc in `` pulp fiction `` . 
`` se7en `` is gori , graphic , and disturb , but all the gore is post-death . 
still , if you tend to get queasi , do n't eat food dure thi film . 
kevin spacey play john doe , the aveng angel who claim that he 's the messeng who will right the wrong with hi teach . 
like mani crazi men , he ha some fine idea , but some sick way of express himself . 
spacey doe n't appear until the final 30 minut and also doe n't receiv bill in the open credit . 
howev , it 's hi appear that turn thi film upsid down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomin . 
a great villain manag to make you either root for him or feel compel to listen to hi rambl regardless of whether you agre with him or not . 
thi charact is so well written that it 's hard to disagre when he say that what he is do will be rememb by everyon . 
no serial killer ha ever been so creativ . 
`` se7en `` is blatantli unsubtl with it messag about the horror of the world and it 's often a littl too depress . 
what it lack in those area , it make up for with believ dialogu , top-notch screenwrit , unexpect twist , and realist charact . 
the technic aspect of the film are unobtrus . 
fincher use light , music , and edit quit well , but hi stori is alway the thrust of the film . 
fortun , we do n't find out what happen to mill and somerset after the close credit ( which are run backward up the screen ! ) . 
it 's better to imagin what path they will follow . 
thi is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickli forget . 
it 's got a sinist messag and john doe is right about one thing -- the evil of the world are n't go to cure themselv . 
`` se7en `` rais some tough question and it 's intellig enough to allow it audienc to answer mani of those question for themselv . 
useless trivia -- co-star in 1995 's `` se7en `` , brad pitt and kevin spacey also compet for the 1995 best support actor oscar -- pitt in `` 12 monkey `` , spacey in `` the usual suspect `` ( for which he won ) .
