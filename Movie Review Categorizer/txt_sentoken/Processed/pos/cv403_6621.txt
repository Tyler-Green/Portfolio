my fellow american is a movi that at first glanc look to have littl substanc ( or a movi that we 've all seen a million time ) , two lifetim rival thrown togeth and then the fun begin . 
thi is exactli what happen in thi movi , but fortun , they manag to do it in an interest and funni way . 
the movi start with a quick ( and i do mean quick ) glanc of two presid russel kramer ( jack lemmon ) and matt dougla ( jame garner ) . 
william haney ( dan aykroyd ) and ted matthew ( john heard ) are the new presid and vice presid . 
there is a scandal that aris involv a kickback from a contractor and haney is posit that he buri that year ago . 
he find a scapegoat in kramer and now everyon want kramer and dougla dead . 
thi movi wa except for mani reason . 
one be that they found peopl ( lemmon and garner ) that have good chemisti togeth . 
they work veri well as a unit and they mirror each other perfectli , one be a ladi man and one be the old man ( i 'll let you fiqur which is which ) . 
also , they found peopl that know their part as goven offici well . 
it seem to me that garner play almost exactli the same role that he play in the distinquish gentleman ( except then he wa a congressman ) . 
experi count for a lot ! !
