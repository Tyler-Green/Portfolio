kolya is one of the richest film i 've seen in some time . 
zdenek sverak play a confirm old bachelor ( who 's like to remain so ) , who find hi life as a czech cellist increasingli impact by the five-year old boy that he 's take care of . 
though it end rather abruptli -- and i 'm whine , 'caus i want to spend more time with these charact -- the act , write , and product valu are as high as , if not higher than , compar american drama . 
thi father-and-son delight -- sverak also wrote the script , while hi son , jan , direct -- won a golden globe for best foreign languag film and , a coupl day after i saw it , walk away an oscar . 
in czech and russian , with english subtitl .
