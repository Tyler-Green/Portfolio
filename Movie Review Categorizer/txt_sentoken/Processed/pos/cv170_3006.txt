i do n't know what movi the critic saw , but it wa n't thi one . 
the popular consensu among newspap critic wa that thi movi is unfunni and dread bore . 
in my person opinion , they could n't be more wrong . 
if you were expect airplan ! -like 
laugh and agatha christie-intens mysteri , then ye , thi movi would be a disappoint . 
howev , if you 're just look for an enjoy movi and a good time , thi is one to see . 
honest , it is . 
thi stori is about a 4th network , wbn , take to america 's airwav in 1939 . 
penni henderson ( mari stuart masterson ) , the station owner 's secretari , must deal with her overbear boss , an unimpress sponsor and writer readi to quit on a moment 's notic , partli due to the fact that they have n't been paid in week . 
among the mayhem , she must also deal with her soon-to-b ex-husband , roger ( brian benben ) who desper want her back . 
unfortun , her problem onli get wors as the night goe on and the bodi count rise without explan . 
while tri to woo penni back , roger must deal with the polic and tri to find the killer that lurk at wbn . 
mari stuart masterson doe well in her role as penni ( i 'm tri to be unbias so i wo n't tell you how amaz she look ) , although brian benben get most of the screen time . 
along with the two lead , are sever recogniz face , includ corbin bernsen ( l . a . 
law ) , michael mckean ( lavern & shirley ) and bobcat goldthwait . 
the special effect are amaz , and fool me ( which some may argu is n't veri difficult to do ) in mani scene . 
although the movi sometim goe overboard with the physic comedi , it more than make up for those mistak throughout the movi . 
overal , i gave it , or an , depend on what system you use .
