disney 's 35th anim featur -- a retool of the olympian legend cross with , well , the superman stori -- is surprisingli soft at the center . 
great wit , great art , and a great villain ( jame wood as hade , lord of the underworld and local loung act ) ca n't quit stifl the yawn induc by a bland hero , hi color monoton sidekick ( danni devito as the satyr trainer phil ) , and a larg unremark soundtrack . 
( none of the alan menken/david zippel tune are particular- ly noteworthi . 
some lack lyric snap . 
other need more memor melodi . 
bore ballad we expect , but bore product number , too ? ) 
so , hercul is a bit of a long sit , but you wo n't stay bore . 
the highlight includ a nifti round of anim action ( herc battl a cgi hydra ) , a steadi stream of anachron ( `` somebodi call ix-i-i `` ) and pop refer ( `` let 's get readi to rumbl ! `` ) a la aladdin , and sever long-overdu jab at the mous 's market and merchandis depart- ment . 
while not as rock-solid as hunchback , it 's a still a new world of improv over pocohonta . 
direct by ron clement and john musker , with voic credit includ tate donovan , susan egan , bob goldthwait , matt frewer , samantha eggar , paul shaffer , and , as light bolt zeu , rip torn , who 's have a veri good summer , also appear in trial and error and men in black .
