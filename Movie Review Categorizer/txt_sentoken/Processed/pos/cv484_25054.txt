susan granger 's review of `` the perfect storm `` ( warner bro . ) 
`` more peopl die on fish boat , per capita , than work in ani other job in the u . s . . 
everi journey a fish boat make can be an all-or-noth risk . 
it is life at it most exhilar and it most terrifi , `` say director wolfgang petersen ( `` da boot `` ) . 
and that 's just what he captur in thi true stori of struggl and human aboard a swordfish boat , the andrea gail , sail out of gloucest , massachusett , in late octob , 1991 . 
earli in bill wittliff 's screenplay , base on sebastian junger 's best-sel , we meet the crew of six . 
the veteran captain ( georg clooney ) is frustrat becaus he ca n't find fish on the grand bank , yet a rival skipper ( mari elizabeth mastrantonio ) bring in huge haul . 
hi right-hand man ( mark walhberg ) need money to build a new life with hi girl-friend ( dian lane ) . 
there 's a devot dad ( john c . reilli ) with an estrang wife and son , a free-spirit jamaican ( allen payn ) , a lone guy ( john hawk ) , and a last-minut replac with a bad attitud ( william fichtner ) . 
the skipper 's convinc he can chang hi bad luck streak in remot flemish cap , and he doe . 
but then troubl begin . 
there 's a rogu wave , a man overboard and the ice machin break - with 60 , 000 lb . 
of fish that could spoil . 
but that 's minor compar with a deadli monster storm approach which a boston meteorologist describ as `` a disast of epic proport `` that also threaten the live of a coast guard helicopt rescu team tri to save three peopl strand on a sailboat on the high sea . 
it 's formula and there are clich , but the wall of water , creat by fluid dynam simul real-lif phenomena , are awesom . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` the perfect storm `` is a terrifi , suspens 8 . 
hang on for the white-knuckl thrill ride of the summer !
