studio expect must not have been high for `` great expect `` -- the film 's releas date wa push from late decemb to late januari at what appear to be the last minut , therefor put ani academi award chanc it ha off until thi time in 1999 . 
it 's actual a smart move , becaus while thi updat take on the charl dicken tale is n't quit oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguish from the cinemat dump ground that usual make up the first five or six week of ani given year . 
`` great expect `` also demonstr how to modern a classic stori right , especi after the excruciatingli wretch excess of baz luhrmann 's `` william shakespear 's romeo + juliet . `` 
`` great expect `` open somewher in 1970 florida ( the origin stori is set in 19th-centuri england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremi jame kissner ) meet a trio of peopl who will have a profound effect on hi life in the futur . 
there 's ici , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beauden ) , a pseudo-playm of finn 's ; ms . dinsmoor ( ann bancroft ) , estella 's aunti who 's quit off-kilt over a past romanc that never took off ; and a mysteri prison ( robert de niro ) whom finn save the life of . 
finn , who live with hi sister 's affabl boyfriend ( lone star 's chri cooper ) , fanci himself an aspir artist , and prove hi prowess by whip up an unusu portrait of estella use onli ms . dinsmoor 's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpap from her dilapid mansion . 
flash forward into the '90 ( after a brief stop in the '80 ) , and finn ( now play by ethan hawk ) , despond over a strang hot-and-cold relationship with the elus estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receiv quit a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it 's enough cash to send him to new york to focu on a career in art . 
there , finn seem to gain everyth he could ever want -- wealth , prestig and a high place in the glamor art world . 
when estella resurfac -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also see the chanc to renew their mutual attract . 
but she 's not the onli ghost from finn 's past that 's go to be pay him a visit . 
comparison with the afore-ment `` romeo + juliet `` seem inevit sinc these film are the onli one in recent memori to plop classic drama into a current set . 
`` great expect `` is a much better ventur , though , becaus it treat it sourc with even-hand respect , where `` romeo `` wa never quit sure whether to be a spoof , a homag or both . 
the movi is a visual banquet thank to emmanuel lubezki 's sexi cinematographi ; notabl , he captur a revisit fountain kiss between the two lead with a lusciou , erot charg that 's steamier than the film 's ( surprisingli mute ) love scene . 
the eclect rock soundtrack compliment the on-screen action beauti , especi new song by tori amo , mono and duncan sheik . 
act credit are first-rat , often hide the screenplay 's occasion slip-up . 
hawk is sincer and solid as a lead man ( someth we also learn from `` gattaca `` ) , and hi finn is quit a likeabl guy . 
paltrow 's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdevelop . 
while the actress is at her icili seduct best , we 're not told veri much about her charact , and as a result , it 's often hard to understand whi finn would appreci her beyond a physic level ( but , oh , * what * a physic level ) ; sometim , we root for finn although we do n't quit understand whi she 's fuel hi fire . 
robert de niro is nice and sophist in the benevol kind of role he rare get to play ; on the other end of the act spectrum is bancroft , a macabr , throati delight who mambo and suck down cigarett with an eeri enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealou . 
alfonso cuaron 's visual eleg direct help to distract from the dri moment that pop up more frequent around the movi 's climax . 
anoth problem is predict ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you are n't familiar with the stori . 
despit it script flaw , though , `` great expect `` is undeni romant without be corni or gloppi . 
and frankli , it 's nice to see a film that embrac soften sensual other than explicit sexual . 
perhap that renov releas date , aw close to valentin 's day , will end up help `` great expect `` ' seemingli averag box offic chanc after all .
