i have seen sever ( but not that mani ) woodi allen movi . 
i did n't particulari like radio day , the purpl rose of cairo , play it again , sam . 
i quit enjoy manhatten murder mysteri and everyth . . . 
sex , and i love might aphrodit . 
howev i found bullet over broadway to be a snooz bore . 
and bullet got some veri rave review , but i did n't think i 'd like . 
but i final saw it ( doubl featur with readi to wear i think ) and hate it . 
sinc . . . 
i love you also seem to be get rave review i wa n't sure if i 'd want to see . . . 
thank i did ! 
peopl burst into sing and danc , someth i hardli ever like . 
but thi movi is so infecti . 
and funni ! 
and entertain ! 
( and unlik evita , they onli sing when they need to . ) 
sure some of the actor may not be great singer , but they seem to be have a great time , and so doe the audienc . 
that 's all i have to say . 
realli , if you think that is go to be a dull movi , you 're probabl dead . 
and dead peopl should not be forc into movi theatr .
