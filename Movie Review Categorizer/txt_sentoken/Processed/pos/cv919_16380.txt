when i first heard that kevin costner wa make a movi call `` the postman , `` i thought , `` an american version of 'il postino ? ' 
star costner ? 
god help us ! `` 
when i found out that it wa not a remak of `` postino `` but an postapocalypt epic , i thought , `` 'landworld ? ' 
pleas , god , make him stop ! `` 
as it turn out , `` the postman `` is a much better film than i had expect . 
despit be set in 2013 , the movi is , at heart , a western : a band of thug terror peac villag ; a wander hero oppos the bandit and inspir other to fight back . 
the set , howev , allow that familiar plot to take on greater signific : american societi ha collaps due to plagu and war , and survivor live behind barracad in isol villag . 
the struggl of a dead societi to be reborn ha a grand qualiti and deserv the epic scale costner grant it . 
costner 's nameless charact , a wander actor , ride in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghai into the servic of gener bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machin salesman turn bandit king . 
our hero escap and discov the bodi of a dead postman . 
take the uniform and bag of mail , he pass himself off as a repres of `` the restor unit state . `` 
he is shock at the hope that he inspir in the peopl he meet . 
one young discipl , ford lincoln mercuri ( larenz tate ) , organ a full-scal postal servic . 
ford spread the postman 's messag of hope until bethlehem find that the once-meek villag are begin to resist hi rule . 
as war break out between bethlehem 's armi and the postal worker , costner 's charact step into the legend he creat and goe from self-cent loner to leader of the revolut . 
hi lie of the restor unit state becom a self-fulfil propheci . 
`` postman `` is an odd blend of a bleak set and a messag of wide-ey optim ( sort of `` sergio leon meet frank capra `` ) , but it treatment of hope and renew is compel . 
what could have been anoth knock-off of `` the road warrior `` ( like `` waterworld `` wa ) surpris the viewer with a sensit told stori of nobil emerg from rubbl . 
tate is the stand-out in the movi 's larg cast . 
ford lincoln mercuri ( self-nam ) is the polar opposit of o-dog , tate 's charact in hi debut film , `` menac ii societi `` ( 1993 ) , and tate make ford 's innoc belief in hope as convinc as o-dog 's cynic and brutal . 
hi perform sell the movi . 
interestingli , as tate move from hi usual street-smart role to youth optim , the soft-ey patton , who usual play nice guy , prove a disarm villain . 
olivia william make her film debut as the postman 's love interest , abbi . 
when they first meet , abbi ask him to father her child becaus her husband is steril . 
predict , the husband is soon elimin by the bandit , and abbi is thrown back into the compani of the hero . 
howev , their relationship develop slowli as the emot conflict of both charact are explor ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resist hi destini ) . 
`` the postman `` is costner 's best work thu far . 
perhap that alon give us hope for the futur .
