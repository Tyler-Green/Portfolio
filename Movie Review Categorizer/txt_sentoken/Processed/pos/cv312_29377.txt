synopsi : shrek ( myer ) is an ogr live in content solitud deep in the heart of a forest , until hi home is invad by fairi tale creatur flee the rule of the evil lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) . 
farquaad agre to reloc the pest , on the condit that shrek rescu princess fiona ( diaz ) -- whom farquaad desir to wed -- from a far-off castl . 
grudgingli , shrek set out , join in hi quest by an unwant companion , donkey ( murphi ) . 
review : one memor aspect of disney 's `` aladdin `` wa that it final gave robin william a charact -- the geni -- to best take advantag of hi comic talent . 
`` shrek `` doe the same for eddi murphi ; iron , though , murphi 's ideal vessel turn out to be an ass . 
all the same , `` shrek `` doe repres murphi 's best comic outing in year , and as donkey he steal all the best line . 
for instanc , after get belt with pixi dust while tri to conceal hi natur as a magic creatur , donkey soar into the air and scoff , `` now i 'm a fli talk donkey ! `` 
and despit it mani contributor , the script for `` shrek `` is full of such comic gem . 
myer is delight in more of a straight man role , and lithgow also get some great moment ( watch for a hilari reparte with the gingerbread man ) . 
`` shrek `` take great pleasur in lampoon fairi tale and nurseri rhyme of all sort , and reserv a few delight knock at disney in the bargain . 
thing do go somewhat astray dure the film 's middl segment , which concentr too much on the main charact at the expens of some of the terrif fairi tale satir which is the movi 's greatest strength . 
but even then , one can alway sit back and enjoy the beauti comput anim , whose remark use here repres yet anoth dazzl leap forward for the technolog .
