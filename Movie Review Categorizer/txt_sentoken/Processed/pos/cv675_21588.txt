three thing i learn from `` be john malkovich `` : when get on the elev for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a build , alway bring your crowbar ; do n't stand in the way of your wife 's actual as a man ; and , whenev enter a portal into the mind of anoth human be , wear old cloth , becaus , hey , it 's muddi in there . 
`` be john malkovich `` is the most origin film to come down the pike in a veri long time . 
wildli surrealist , yet present in a down-to-earth , funki style , thi is the kind of movi that stick in your head . 
after savor the sheer invent of the storylin , you roll around the wealth of idea contain within it . 
from the ethic of relationship and polit of immort to the veri natur of ident itself , there 's a lot to think about here . 
just do n't forget to have fun . 
clearli , all parti involv in the make of the film certainli did , start with writer charl kaufman . 
`` i wrote 'be john malkovich ' without an outlin , `` he explain in the press note , `` blindli , with no sens of direct or purpos . 
it 's import to me that i do n't have a map befor i start . 
thi allow me to surpris myself , stay engag , discov thing , and , hope , allow the unconsci to surfac . `` 
spike jonz ( mark wahlberg 's na ? ve buddi in `` three king `` ) take it from there . 
the white-hot director of the beasti boy 's `` sabotag , `` an award-win parodi of '70 tv cop show , as well as numer other music video and commerci , eschew typic mtv flash for hi featur film debut . 
jonz wise realiz that a storylin thi unusu is most effect present in a low-key style . 
hi flat , matter-of-fact approach work perfectli . 
and then there 's the cast . 
john cusack play control freak craig schwartz , a street perform who period get deck by parent object to hi remark express , but decidedli erot puppet show . 
over the year , hi marriag to obsess pet store employe lott ( cameron diaz ) ha devolv . 
onc passion lover , the two are now littl more than courteou roommat . 
financi strap , craig take a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , locat on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan build . 
navig around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , hi 105 year-old boss and flori ( mari kay place ) , lester 's dotti secretari , craig tri to settl into hi new posit , but two thing keep him distract . 
first , there 's the beauti and imperi maxin ( catherin keener ) , who delight in torment craig over hi obviou lust for her . 
and then there 's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turn out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich . 
craig learn that anyon who enter the portal get whoosh into the subconsci of malkovich , where they can experi life from hi point of view ( with enough concentr , you can even influenc hi action ) . 
after 15 minut , the visitor get eject and unceremoni dump in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpik . 
then thing get a littl weird . 
by the way , if you 're concern that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assur - - i bare scratch the surfac . 
one of the most satisfi aspect of the fabl is that kaufman is not content to simpli milk laugh from hi bizarr set-up . 
instead , he crawl into the dark premis as complet as craig crawl into malkovich , rummag around and toy with the variou philosoph implic of compromis anoth person 's ident . 
he also examin the consequ of the malko-visit to craig , lott , maxin and , of cours , john malkovich himself . 
the perform are superb . 
malkovich ( best known to mainstream audienc for hi work in `` danger liaison , `` `` in the line of fire , `` and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasur `` con air `` ) tweak hi own imag in a dandi self-deprec turn . 
far from hi effet , vagu reptilian persona , thi malkovich is just anoth schlub , drink with hi pal and tri to get laid ( incident , charli sheen also play himself in a hilari parodi of hi well-earn bad boy reput ) . 
as alway , john cusack nail hi part , handili pull viewer along even as craig 's action becom unconscion . 
the big surpris come from catherin keener and cameron diaz , both play against type . 
kenner , usual cast in ici subordin role , is terrif as a highli intellig , extrem manipul femm fatal . 
cameron diaz , bare recogniz under a mess of brown , curli hair , shed her perpetu sunni smile and draw big laugh as a woman thrown into extrem sexual confus after take a ride in malkovich . 
`` be john malkovich `` stumbl toward the end , as jonz and kaufman tri too hard to resolv the variou subplot . 
addit charact and increasingli complex explan lead to a clutter final . 
regardless , thi contemporari `` alic in wonderland `` is a real treat . 
i enjoy watch `` be john malkovich , `` but onli later , after reflect on the film , did it reson fulli hit me . 
at one point , craig say , `` do you know what a metaphys can of worm thi portal is ? `` 
truer word were never spoken .
