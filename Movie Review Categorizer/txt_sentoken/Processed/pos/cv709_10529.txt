some movi have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credit have roll , make you think care and recollect on what you have just seen . 
i finish mike figgi ' `` leav la vega `` hour ago , and it is still as haunt as when i hit rewind on the vcr . 
alot of peopl refer to thi film as `` that flick where nick cage play that alcohol dude `` . 
`` leav la vega `` is not so much a movi about alcohol as it is a stori about two peopl who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore . 
ben ( nicola cage in possibl the best male perform of the past twenti year ) is the drunk . 
hi famili and friend have long sinc abandon him , and all he ha left is hi liquor . 
in a scene earli in the film , we see ben stagger into a resteraunt , look for a `` friend `` of hi to mooch some money off of . 
he find the guy ( richard lewi ) have dinner with a buddi and two chick , tri to crack witti joke that just come out stupid . 
when ben approach the tabl , you can clearli sens that everyon immediatli feel uncomfort . 
after lewi give ben the money , he coldli say `` i think it would be best if you did n't contact me again . `` 
now even though through the cours of the film , some much more depress thing happen , thi is when i felt the most for ben . 
there wa such a look of sorrow and dispar on hi face , ( not to sound hokey or anyth ) it almost brought a tear to my eye . 
it turn out that ben wa onc a semi-success hollywood player , and appar a pretti popular guy . 
now he spend hi time get rob by hooker and tri desperatli to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the compani ; for someon to talk to or spend time with . 
onc he is fire from hi job , ben decid to burn all hi belong , collect all hi cash and reloc to la vega to slowli drink himself to death . 
one night he run into a prostitut ( a brilliant perform by elizabeth shue - how far she ha come sinc `` adventur in babysit `` ) name sera . 
she is involv in an abus relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cut her . 
they are both veri lone , self-destruct peopl . 
they immediatli hit it off , both of them realiz that they need one anoth . 
and it is n't even a sexual relationship . 
they do n't even have sex until , like , the last ten minut of the film . 
`` leav la vega `` is not a film about plot . 
with the except of what i have alreadi reveal ( which all happen in the first thirti minut or so , by the way ) , there is n't too much of a stori to it . 
it is more a film about peopl and how they react to one anoth . 
from what i can see , thi is basic a perfect film . 
the direct is great ( with mike figgi do a brilliant mix between the glamor of la vega and the moodi , smokey atmospher of a film noir ) and it contain two of the best perform to come out of the 90 , or ani other decad for that matter . 
but do n't go rush out to see thi movi without know what you 're get yourself into . 
first off , if you are easili offend by frank sexual dialoug , stay away from `` leav la vega `` . 
it is fill with lengthi discuss of orgasm , rape and variou form of pervert activ involv burbon ( that 's right ) . 
secondli , if you are not in the mood to see a veri depress film , do n't see it . 
howev , if you are cool with those two thing , you are in for one of the most memor experi you will ever have .
