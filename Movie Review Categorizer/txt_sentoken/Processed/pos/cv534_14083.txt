the heartbreak kid ( review on aug . 26th/1998 ) 
star charl grodin , cybil sheppard , eddi albert 
in `` the heartbreak kid `` , charl grodin play one of the most unbeliev obnoxi charact i 've seen on screen in a long time . 
he 's a guy who spend virtual the entir run time of the movi bullshit hi way from one situat to anoth . 
i doubt he ever express ani genuin feel at all dure the film . 
as the film open , he ha just gotten marri , and is on the way to miami beach for hi honeymoon . 
halfway there , he begin to resent hi bride . 
by the time he arriv at hi hotel and ha met the cybil sheppard charact , he is readi to divorc hi wife . 
as play by grodin , thi charact is the type of person that noth will ever be good enough for him . 
the phrase `` the grass is alway greener on the other side of the fenc `` wa practic written with him in mind . 
howev , if he find someth he realli want , he will pursu it for as long as it take . 
the onli problem is , onc he ha it , he immedi lose interest . 
the end of `` the heartbreak kid `` is both hilari and sad for that veri reason . 
charl grodin is at hi smarmi best here , and sheppard is quit appeal as the object of grodin 's desir . 
howev , the real scene stealer is jeanni berlin , daughter of director elain may , as grodin 's whini bride . 
she own everi scene that she 's in , and make you almost want to root for what the grodin charact is tri to do . 
`` the heartbreak kid `` wa written by neil simon and it show . 
simon love to deconstruct and analyz human relationship , and he 's at the top of hi game here . 
as maddeningli obnoxi as the grodin charact is , he 's the type of guy that everyon know . 
the charact of georg costanza on `` seinfeld `` seem to have been model after him . 
the onli problem with the film is that it 's not that funni , and it 's bill as a comedi . 
as much as i could see the realism in the charact , it would have been nice to have a chuckl here and there . 
`` the heartbreak kid `` is not a date movi . 
it ha an extrem neg view of relationship , so see it with a girlfriend/boyfriend , could be hazardu to your health .
