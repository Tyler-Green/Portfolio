` strang day ' chronicl the last two day of 1999 in lo angel . 
as the local gear up for the new millenium , lenni nero ( ralph fienn ) goe about hi busi of peddl erot memori clip . 
he pine for hi ex-girlfriend , faith ( juliett lewi ) , not notic that anoth friend , mace ( angela bassett ) realli care for him . 
thi film featur good perform , impress film-mak techniqu and breath-tak crowd scene . 
director kathryn bigelow know her stuff and doe not hesit to use it . 
but as a whole , thi is an unsatisfi movi . 
the problem is that the writer , jame cameron and jay cock , were too ambiti , aim for a film with social relev , thrill , and drama . 
not that ambiti film-mak should be discourag ; just that when it fail to achiev it goal , it fail badli and obvious . 
the film just end up preachi , unexcit and uninvolv .
