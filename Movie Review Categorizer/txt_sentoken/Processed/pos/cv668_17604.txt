in decemb of 1996 , a littl movi call `` scream , `` wa releas , becam a box-offic smash , and resurrect film target at teen . 
first , it wa teen slasher movi that were the big fad ( both `` scream `` movi , `` i know what you did last summer , `` `` urban legend , `` etc . ) , but just recent , the popular ha switch over to the teen comedi genr ( a 'la '80 john hugh ) , start with last june 's `` ca n't hardli wait . `` 
it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far thi year we have been given a movi aim at the 25-and-und market almost everi singl week : `` varsiti blue , `` `` jawbreak , `` `` cruel intent , `` `` simpli irresist , `` `` the rage : carri 2 , `` and `` the mod squad . `` 
come april 9 are two more of thi type : `` never been kiss `` and `` go , `` and on april 23 , we 've got the teen satir `` elect `` and the teen horror-comedi `` idl hand . `` 
jeesh ! 
out of all of these move , howev , the one that is most similar to the latest incarn , `` 10 thing i hate about you , `` is thi past januari 's mediocr , ho-hum `` she 's all that . `` 
although similar in plot ( ok , darn near ident ) , `` 10 thing i hate about you , `` a modern-day version of shakespear 's `` the tame of the shrew `` ( `` she 's all that `` got it inspir from `` pygmalion `` ) , is an infinit superior film in everi depart , from the smart direct by first-tim featur director gil junger to the charm and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the strike ensembl cast , who give the best group of perform in a teen comedi sinc 1985 's `` the breakfast club . `` 
and to top it all off , in the inevit climax set at the prom , at least we did n't have to onc again suffer through a goofi , inappropri danc sequenc ( who could forget , or want to rememb , for that matter , thi ludicr develop in `` she 's all that ? `` ) . 
the day wide-ey , shi new student cameron jame ( joseph gordon-levitt ) start school at seattle-bas padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beauti and popular sophomor , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . 
although he doe n't know french , he purpos learn some of it just so he can tutor her , but find that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larri miller ) wo n't allow her to date until her bitter , unconvent older sister , kat ( julia stile ) , a senior , decid to . 
kat , of cours , ha sworn off the like of boy , but cameron set out to find someon that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactli what he find in the form of the rebelli patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . 
complic matter , cameron 's dorki friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decid to use a wealthi jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also ha hi sight set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hope to steal bianca away from joey . 
as you can see , `` 10 thing i hate about you `` includ a huge number of charact , some of which i have n't even mention , such as kat 's shakespeare-obsess friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca 's materialist comrad , chastiti ( gabriel union ) . 
at a short , but well-us run time of 98 minut , all of the charact are perfectli handl , satisfyingli develop , and , for the most part , are not treat as caricatur ( anoth flaw of `` she 's all that , `` where the bad guy ( and gal ) ran around constantli say , `` you 're vapor `` ) . 
sinc i could sympath with the realist depict of the central charact , and sinc mani of the comed and dramat scene were surprisingli effect , i got complet caught up in all of the relationship and wa thoroughli entertain . 
asid from a good screenplay , it 's the perform that can make or break a movi , and director junger ha realli hit the jackpot . 
asid from joseph gordon-levitt ( `` 3rd rock from the sun `` ) , who give hi strongest perform to date here , none of the actor are that well-known , but it is thi aspect that bring a particular fresh to the proceed . 
as the main charact of kat , julia stile ( last seen in the miniseri `` the '60 `` ) is marvel and alway believ , and certainli ha a bright futur ahead of her . 
even though it is her role that is initi the most difficult and hard-edg , it wa easi to identifi with kat 's way of think ( she is against the silli tradit of the prom and love read sylvia plath ) , and i complet admir her individu . 
no one , i think , could have portray her as perfectli as stile doe . 
heath ledger , as the infam bad-boy of the town , inject much life into patrick , and ha a lot of chemistri with stile . 
one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwrit lutz and smith , is abl to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimens , even though she is accur self-cent at the on-set . 
in one truth scene , cameron angrili ask her if she ha alway been so selfish , and bianca grudgingli realiz that ye , she ha . 
one off-beat element of the film , and a sourc of some hearti laugh , is the way that the school 's staff act , which is strikingli unform . 
allison janney , as the guidanc counselor ms . perki , who is write a trashi harlequin romanc novel , is comic dynamit , as is daryl `` chill `` mitchel as the english teacher , who read shakespear to the class in rap and , at one point , send kat to the offic becaus , for onc , she actual think one of hi assign is realli good . 
although there are a few cheap laugh that are thrown into the film near the begin , most of it actual work , especi in the humor and witti dialogu exchang and quirk between the charact . 
in one veri funni scene , chastiti ask , `` i know peopl can be overwhelm , and they can be underwhelm , but can peopl just be . . . whelm ? `` 
at anoth point , bianca and kat 's father ( a stand-out larri miller ) , who is constantli terrifi that hi daughter are go to get pregnant , onli allow bianca to go to the prom on one occas : befor she leav , she ha to put on the heavi fat suit he ha so she will get an idea of what it 's like to be pregnant . 
`` 10 thing i hate about you `` onc and for all prove that there is still life in the teen comedi genr , and thi movi is probabl more reminisc of the great john hugh than ani other film of the '90 . 
it also help that the movi ha a perfectly-assembl soundtrack , mix indie-rock with new wave '80 song ( and with , thank good , no rap ) . 
by the film 's end , it actual had me root for certain charact to get togeth , and i wa also quit pleas with how everyth wa wrap up , especi in the final scene involv kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-act and move sequenc in which kat get up to read the poem she ha written for her english class ( thi is where the titl come from ) . 
luckili , i doubt i would be abl to find ten thing i hate about `` 10 thing i hate about you , `` but the posit aspect of the film far out-numb ten .
