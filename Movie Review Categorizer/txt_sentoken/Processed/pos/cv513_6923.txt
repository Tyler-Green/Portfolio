when i first heard that romeo & juliet had been `` updat `` i shudder . 
i thought that yet anoth of shakespear 's classic had been destroy . 
fortun , i wa wrong . 
baz luhrman ha direct an `` in your face `` , and visual stun piec with thi film . 
it revolv around the two rival famili , who in thi version each run multi-million dollar enterpris . 
these rival companies/famili are the capulet 's and the montagu 's . 
the younger gener of these two famili have form gang , who despis one anoth . 
as the storylin goe , romeo montagu ( play by leonardo dicaprio ) and juliet capulet ( clair dane ) meet at a fanci dress parti , and it is love at first site . 
i never believ love at first site wa possibl until i saw thi film , the scene in which romeo 's eye meet juliet 's through the fish tank is one of the most memor . 
of cours , they can not publicli reveal their love , for their famili are arch enemi . 
so they marri in secret , thi is where thing begin to go wrong . 
the stori , as with all good shakespear , end in tragedi . 
the cinematographi is spectacular to say the least , and the soundtrack provid the perfect atmospher in which to `` lay our scene `` , as the film say . 
there is veri littl to criticis . 
the perform are convinc , and sever of the film 's younger star may find that it provid a launch for their career . 
the modernis of the script is ingeni and clever . 
despit the well known storylin , thi latest version still manag to caus tear among mani member of the audienc ( especi the younger gener ) , and thi is certainli a great credit to the film .
