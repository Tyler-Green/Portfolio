thi is one of the most funni and entertain comedi of the year and it just happen to be anim . 
there are some great voic over commentari from hollywood 's most famou celebr , some fabul anim and a compel stori . 
thi is the best we 've seen from disney sinc `` beauti and the beast `` ( 1996 ) . 
thi film begin an unspecifi time follow the happily-ever-aft conclus to toy stori . 
in the aftermath of their earlier adventur , buzz ( voic of tim allen ) and woodi ( voic of tom hank ) are now fast friend and all the toy live in perfect harmoni , content with their `` live `` . 
one day , andi broke woodi 's arm off , while play with him . 
woodi is now offici discarg and worthless , left with hi nightmar , where he lie in a trash can with the other discard . 
later andi 's mother decid to have a yard sale , and she collect a few old toy from her son 's room . 
sinc one of these discard is a member of the move toy gang , woodi goe to the rescu , leav the safeti of the hous for the uncertainti of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back . 
although hi mission is success , he is place in a seriou predica when a toy collector name al ( voic of wayn knight ) spi woodi while hunt through the ware avail at the sale . 
the cowboy toy repres the final collect need to complet hi collect of merchandis from the old tv seri , `` woodi 's roundup . `` 
if he can acquir woodi , al can ship everyth to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit . 
so , after andi 's mother refus to sell the wooden cowboy , al steal him , and it 's up to the other toy , led by buzz , to go into the citi to save their friend . 
and so , buzz , rex ( voic of wallac shawn ) , hamm ( voic of john ratzenberg ) , mr . potatohead ( voic of don rickl ) , and slinki ( voic of jim varney ) , go out on a danger journey to rescu their friend , they find themselv confront thing like busi street and other buzz lightyear toy . 
there are car chase , gun fight and final the confront between buzz and hi nemesi ( who , by the way , resembl darth vader ) . 
meanwhil , woodi learn that he wa onc a tv celebr and ha a famili - a cowgirl name jessi ( voic of joan cusack ) , a hors name bullsey , and a father figur call the prospector ( voic of kelsey grammar ) . 
they offer him anoth life , as a celebr -- a toy in a museum in japan . 
he is now forc to choos between be love intens by andi for a littl while ( befor he grow up ) and be forgotten , or be admir by children for gener . 
the problem is , if woodi escap from al 's clutch and return home , they will end up back in the lone dark of storag . 
a real effort is made in the technic depart . 
the anim is rich and color , with lot of wonder detail . the `` cinematographi `` is also extrem improv sinc toy stori ; there are a lot of complic swing , turn and close-up that realli make an impress . 
light and filter are use to creat a mood ( as in a surprisingli emot moment - jessi 's remembr of her day when she wa a belov toy ) the film contain a lot of in-sid joke ( such as the one about videogam ) , and entertain parodi on `` jurass park `` and `` star war `` . 
the film end with the `` fail take `` , the kind of scene that we are use to see after comedi show on tv . 
these outtak are some of the funniest scene in the film . 
but what in the end make `` toy stori 2 `` a memor experi is not the joke , it multipl parodi or marvel anim . 
it is it heart and emot -- the stori about the mean of friendship , love and even life itself . 
it is not difficult to predict that `` toy stori 2 `` would be a huge econom success , but it artist achiev wa unexpect . 
unexpect becaus the first film wa n't much more than a demonstr of special effect . 
but mostli it wa unexpect becaus disney ha n't produc anyth spectacular in year and is constantli surpass by compani such as dreamwork and warner br . 
but here the director ha chang the atmospher of the film , make it more access and interest for person older that 9 year . 
thi is a big step-away from the ancient law of disney-anim . 
off cours , thi is not `` antz `` , it is not as intellig ; thi is not a landmark and no masterpiec , but i promis that you 'll find it as funni and enjoy as i have . 
whether thi is the best anim film of the year , i dare not say . 
my choic would probabl be `` the iron giant `` , but ( along side with `` american pie `` ) thi is the comedi of the year . 
i almost lost my hope for disney , but `` toy stori 2 `` prove that disney ha n't lost their abil to entertain .
