[ light spoiler , noth you should n't read ] 
existenz ha been call `` a gooey matrix `` , and while thi is a correct descript in some way , in other it is complet off . 
the onli thing the two film have in common is the idea of a virtual realiti that is indistinguish from normal , `` real `` realiti . 
a major differ is that `` the matrix `` ha a base realiti that is obvious the true realiti , while existenz doe the imposs and make us accept the most bizarr realiti ever as true . 
and oh what a realiti it is . 
david cronenberg ha shown us befor that he know how to creat strang movi ( nake lunch , crash ) , but thi one is one of the strangest . 
mayb it 's becaus of how the mundan is mix with the bizarr . 
technolog is organ , but onli some of it . 
car are normal . 
ga station are the same . 
cell phone are glow bug like appendag . 
you jack into a virtual realiti game use a quiver pink gooey anim like apparatu ( refer to simpli as a `` pod `` ) . 
high technolog ha been replac with organ creatur , and it provid a truli surreal set for the charact . 
a famou game design , allegra geller ( a fine look jennif jason leigh ) , flee a demonstr of her latest game , existenz , after an assassin attempt . 
she is on the run ( from who , i 'm still not sure ) , and ha to save her pod by play her game with `` someon friendli `` . 
that someon friendli is her dubiou companion and secur guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . 
unfortun he is lack a fundament requir for play , a bioport . 
sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactli like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allow you to plug the vagu entrail-look wire from the pod into you , allow you to play the game . 
luckili a bioport can be instal easili ( they instal them in mall ) , so off they go to get one . 
after a crazi seri of event at the local countri ga station , they are abl to plug in and play existenz . 
the plot itself is a surreal meld of conspiraci , realiti distort , chines restaur , and multi appendag amphibian thing ( `` it 's a sign of the time `` ) . 
but the plot , while cohes in it 's own creepi way is secondari to just tri to figur out what the hell is go on in thi univers . 
cronenberg just slap thi weird organic-tech world into the viewer lap , and it 's up to you to figur out how all these thing work . 
and that 's the true joy of thi film , enter the vagu nightmarish world in which existenz take place . 
you learn a littl bit piec by piec ( oh , they make pod out of those ) , and it 's just enough to get you to accept the world that is present to you . 
there are all kind of twist and turn as the charact wander around , includ a fantast scene in a chines restaur that will leav you tri to assembl someth out of your moo goo gai pan for month afterward . 
also the bioport are occasion use for thing other than port into existenz , the specif of which i will leav for you to discov . 
there 's lot of littl thing that set off the weird-o-met , like the littl tini pod that you can buy in the video game store , the two head amphibian creatur , and whi that guy at the ga station 's name appear to be `` ga `` . 
it all add up to a suprem far out trip , and given the choic i think i would rather live in the matrix 's virtual world . . . 
oh wait , i alreadi do .
