most movi seem to releas a third movi just so it can be call a trilog . 
rocki iii seem to kind of fit in that categori , but manag to be slightli uniqu . 
the rocki formula of `` rocki lose fight/rocki trains/rocki win fight `` is carri out to the letter . 
also the 'tradit ' of show the last five minut or so from the past rocki film is use as well . 
thi movi begin with a seri of clip show how famou rocki ( sylvest stallon ) ha becom . . . 
even show a brief appear on sesam street ! ! 
then it move on with rocki be in a fix fight with thunderlip ( hulk hogan ) . 
a mysteri bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talk to rocki about hi stupid decis to retir from box and that he `` piti the fool `` for not come out and fight him outright . 
rocki 's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tell rocki not to fight , but the italian stallion doe n't listen . 
natur , he get hi ass kick . 
somewher along the line after thi sever thing happen . 
rocki 's longtim trainer die , caus rocki to train with hi former oppon apollo creed . 
rocki 's wife complain to her husband that he should fight . 
the final fight ensu between clubber and rocki . 
guess who win ? 
the winner 's name rhyme with 'smocki ' . 
the movi is entertan mainli becaus of clubber lang 's over the top perform . 
the dramat aspect ha been tone down consider sinc rocki ii and now action seem to be the strong point of the film . 
which is good if you like fight scene . 
the last match is quit decent actual . 
if you like the previou film , rent thi one . 
it 's well worth see if you are a fan of the seri . 
but if you ca n't stand rocki shout `` adriann ! ! ! `` 
one more time , see someth els .
