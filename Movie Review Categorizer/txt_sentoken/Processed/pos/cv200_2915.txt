a common complaint amongst film critic is `` whi are n't there more liter script avail ? `` 
quiz show give sign of hope that the art of write is n't dead in hollywood and that we need not onli look to independ film for thought content . 
paul attanasio 's script take what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandal of the late 50 ) and deliv a tell parabl about the empti of the post war american dream and the golden bubbl that surround and protect tv network and their sponsor . 
the film is riddl with tell symbol ( e . g . 
a '58 chrysler , a radio announc of sputnik ) but is never heavi hand . 
deft direct by robert redford and keen perform by ralph fienn , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectli with the care hone script . 
redford depart from the usual overlight , `` cabl tv qualiti `` set and camera work so common in recent 20th centuri period piec . 
quiz show perfectli captur the color and textur of the eisenhow year . 
although i wa onli 4 year old when the `` twenti one `` scandal broke , enough of the 50 icon surviv throughout my childhood for me to recogn the authent of redford 's almost tangibl palett . 
from plastic cover furnitur to care coif contest , the imag ring true from that era of rampant consumer , of a gener that had gone through 15 year of depress and world war without `` dispos incom , `` befor the manifest of it american dream . 
the film deftli weav sever theme togeth , from assimil and exclus of jew from `` the good life , `` to the length that a scion of a literari famili will go to to match hi father 's fame . 
though the 50 audienc that is `` rock `` by thi scandal may initi seem naiv to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current nation passion for the rise and fall of icon like michael jackson or tonya hard . 
charl van doren and herbi stempl were the overnight mega celebr of their day . 
the tv audienc is almost a fourth main charact , alway at the center of the decis be made on their behalf . 
at the film 's end , the credit roll past slow motion footag of that same 50 tv audienc , mindlessli laugh at some piec of fluff . 
like the distort mirror that captur a blur swastika at the end of cabaret , thi `` mirror `` may reflect an imag we 're not all that comfort with .
