as a devout atheist and an avow believ in alien , i have some idea of how elli aroway ( jodi foster ) feel . 
but becaus my reason for not partak in religion are differ than her , i ca n't say that i do exactli . 
her reason is that she need solid proof : there is no proof that god exist , so therefor she doe not believ . 
elli also believ in alien , and ha spent most of her life tri to prove they exist . 
how can she say she doe n't believ in god becaus of the lack of proof , and then say she believ in alien , which are gereal less believ in than god without sound like a hypocrit ? 
that 's the catch-22 . 
when alien from the star vega fax her some plan for a devic to transport someon to them ( okay , well , they did n't realli * fax * them . . . ) 
elli want to be the one to go , but becaus of her atheism she is deni the posit . 
how dumb is that ? 
she discov the transmit , then she is n't allow to go . 
well , becaus of a bomb and a psychopath ( jake busey ) , she * doe * end up go , but not in the way that we would 've thought . 
contact is base on a novel by carl sagan , who die dure the filmmak . 
it is the best alien movi sinc close encount of the 3rd kind , and will end up be the best film of the year . 
it view of scienc and religion will no doubt aggriv some , but will stimul more . 
i 'm glad at least one movi of the '90 can portray alien in a psitiv light , rather than a bunch of slimey beast who will eat your insid and then put on your bodi .
