review by jamahl epsicokhan -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 
the most iron aspect of nuclear war is that it doe n't have a win side and a lose side . 
in a nuclear confront , everybodi lose , and the aftereffect have devast effect that impact the entir world -- assum the world surviv . 
the idea -- and perhap the onli real option -- is to avoid war at all cost . 
thi is the theme of sidney lumet 's `` fail-saf , `` a fiction drama base on the novel by eugen burdick and harvey wheeler . 
`` fail-saf `` take place dure the heart of the cold war ( the actual film wa releas two year after the cuban missil crisi ) , when the unit state and the soviet union were in static discord over an issu that can be summar in a singl word : commun . 
the premis center around a combin of accid and oper flaw . 
five u . s . bomber carri nuclear warhead are order to set a routin cours for moscow after an unidentifi aircraft is spot head toward america . 
the unidentifi aircraft turn out to be a commerci airlin , but a mechan failur strike the militari base that command the bomber . 
suddenli out of contact , and with stand order to remain on cours until receiv new direct , the bomber pilot can not be recal , and they proceed to moscow with the intent of destroy it with a nuclear strike . 
a great deal of `` fail-saf `` 's plot follow variou charact as they attempt to devis way of stop the u . s . bomber from reach russia 's border -- at ani cost . 
the plot is compel , and the stori creat urgenc and dread by paint the grimmest of worst case scenario . 
the realiti set in quickli as one attempt to turn the bomber after anoth fail . 
gener bogan ( frank overton ) , take order directli from the presid of the unit state himself ( henri fonda ) , is powerless -- the fate of the world lie in the hand of an autom , pre-program system that may not be stoppabl , simpli becaus the creator of the war machin were too effici in their task to make a no-win situat winnabl . 
the event in `` fail-saf `` are fascin becaus they 're anyth but predict , but the real reason `` fail-saf `` work is becaus it understand more about nuclear war than what exist within the confin of it plot . 
a key ingredi to the film is it abil to creat an ongo polem about nuclear war , commun , the cold war , and the unit state ' role in all of it . 
most of thi is through the film 's use of the charact groeteschel ( walter matthau ) , an arrog civilian theorist of nuclear weapon use who , incident , is on the presid 's advis staff for analyz the statist plausibl of wage a nuclear war . 
mani of the film 's most point messag aris from discuss where groeteschel is one of the key voic . 
earli in the film , he host a dinner parti where he explain the import of `` strategi `` in a nuclear assault to `` minim `` casualti . 
`` what 's the differ between 60 million and 100 million dead ? `` 
a guest ask impati . 
`` forti million , `` groeteschel respond wryli . 
the problem with groeteschel 's mindset is that he * believ * nuclear combat to be a viabl method of war . 
the onli differ to him between nuclear armageddon and convent warfar is the raw data and the casualti total . 
groeteschel realiz that these weapon can destroy the world sever time over . 
yet hi answer to the arm race is not to slow down and tri to cool the situat off , as gener black ( dan o'herlihi ) ha often recommend . 
on the contrari -- accord to groeteschel , that would lead to russia have * more * nuclear weapon than the u . s . , which would clearli put america at a disadvantag . 
such a stanc wa perhap the central paradox and misguid practic of the arm race . 
`` fail-saf `` clearli see it as one of the central issu of the cold war , and , likewis , it becom a central theme in the film . 
whi continu to build such machin of mass destruct while alreadi possess enough of them to destroy the world sever time over ? 
is it wise ? 
is it even logic ? 
no , not realli . 
although `` fail-saf `` is more about the issu of nuclear weapon than it is about the polit ramif of commun , there is a scene in the film that deal with commun in an intent superfici , one-sid sort of way . 
again , thi is achiev through groeteschel , who is easili the film 's most import charact in term of the larger-them signific . 
in addit to provid the central `` pro-nuclear war `` voic that the film warn against , he also make key remark about communist that show just how much fear and resent peopl of the period were prone to when it came to commun . 
the context the film use suggest that thi hatr wa often glib . 
one of groeteschel 's `` logic `` train of thought ventur so far into fantasi theoret predict that it 's mere absurd . 
he label the averag marxist an `` unfeel , calcul machin `` that will do whatev it take to preserv itself . 
groeteschel take it so far as to say that if the u . s . drop the warhead on moscow , the soviet will * instantli * surrend , for to retali would invit counter-measur that would further destroy russia 's home soil -- which must be preserv at all cost . 
groeteschel seem to forget these peopl are human be with emot ; gener black quickli remind him that the soviet would attack out of reveng -- as ani normal person would . 
the ironi here is groeteschel 's own mechan theoriz . 
he is so quick to judg the enemi that he doe n't even realiz hi own seemingli program thought pattern . 
onc the film make it evid that turn the u . s . bomber will be imposs , the question becom what the * consequ * of destroy moscow will be . 
just how will the soviet union 's leader react , and what can the presid do to convey hi best intent ? 
( just * how * doe one pass off the death of million of peopl as an * mishap * ? ) 
with the help of hi translat buck ( larri hagman ) , the presid negoti at length with the soviet leader , in scene that prove amazingli taut and power in their simplic , with lumet 's long take of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchang the dialog between the presid and the soviet leader . 
without get into too much detail , i will say that the compromis they ultim reach is veri costli , yet necessari and as sensibl as possibl under the circumst . 
( that is , as sensibl as a nuclear `` incid `` can probabl be . ) 
it doe accomplish what it must : it avoid an all-out war , someth that simpli is n't possibl becaus of it all-too-r consequ . 
dramat , the end is quit power , and the use of o'herlihi 's charact as the symbol `` matador `` ( provid a bookend to the film by end the stori while tie into hi dream sequenc from the film 's open ) , is particularli appropri . 
`` fail-saf `` is a product of a major hollywood studio ( releas by columbia pictur ) , and it ha the structur of a high-tens suspens thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . 
nevertheless , under lumet 's direct and walter bernstein 's intellig adapt of burdick 's and wheeler 's novel , the film continu to have a last effect even after the event on screen have unfold . 
the film often warn that the autom of war is someth that may make nuclear holocaust an unintent consequ of such mass arm . 
but it wa the consciou , human choic to * initi * thi automat arm that `` fail-saf `` also find danger . 
in retrospect , the arm race seem to be one of the most puzzl exercis in futil of the centuri . 
it 's just fortun that both side were final abl to come to their sens and slow down , rather than continu groeteschel 's danger approach of speed up and caus a possibl meltdown .
