bruce lee wa a bigger-than-lif martial artist ( and ) actor . 
bruce 's uniqu charact ( i . e . , self-produc sound effect , etc . ) and seemingli perfect martial art and physiqu were all well portray by the actor , jame lee . 
the stori is told from hi wife linda 's point of view where she put a lot of famili and practic side of bruce lee 's life . 
howev , you ca n't help but like , whenev the fight scene are on , what he can doe with hi bodi and that familiar bruce attitud and charact . 
i also like the littl bit of insight scene about bruce lee 's life befor he becam famou : scene like bruce practic pronunci of english . 
it seem as if he wa no better than anybodi els . 
scene like bruce deliv chines food as a deliveri boy rid a bike through the american colleg look at the ( all-whit ) student , cheerlead , and athlet . 
it seem he too wish for the american dream and hope . 
in conclus , the movi wa well made , it produc a realiz of who bruce lee wa , and actor jame lee wa so much like bruce you have to remind yourself that he is just an actor . 
and the fight scene were all excel . 
so go see it and enjoy the movi . 
p . s . if you have seen the movi unforgiven by clint eastwood , then the feel left after dragon wa veri much like the feel you got after the unforgiven .
