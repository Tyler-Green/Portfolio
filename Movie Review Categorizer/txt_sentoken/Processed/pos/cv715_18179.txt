bob the happi bastard 's quicki review : 
i must admit , no doubt 's singl `` new `` is quit catchi . 
it wa bounci and energet enough to get me to go see thi new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humor swinger a littl while back . 
the result ? 
a movi that 's just as good as that song , realli . 
it follow the live of sever individu over the cours of one weekend . 
first we hear about a groceri bagger ( sara polley ) who run into a monetari situat problem and end up sell bogu drug at a rave ( with bad result , as a drug dealer feel he 's been swindl by her ) ; then come the stori of an english groceri store worker ( same store ) who head to vega for the weekend with friend , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car troubl come into play ; then we see the stori of two gay movi actor ( play by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop 's strang insur present and hit a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , final , we come to anoth groceri worker ( kati holm ) who ha a strang fascin with said drug dealer ( the one mention earlier ) . 
realli , it 's all confus to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go . 
the movi featur some veri good act from all angl , and limon add the same humor energi he had with swinger to thi particular product . 
the dialogu is pretti snappi and the resolut is pretti well realiz , not go for the sappi happi end nor the dread bad end . 
think of it as a , well , end . 
the intertwin of stori is a particularli good element to the movi , as it 's never realli confus and tell differ side of the stori , like slide door kinda did . 
howev , it 's better suit for the younger gener who want a littl spice in their flick , which slide door kinda is n't .
