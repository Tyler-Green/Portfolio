the happi bastard 's 30-second review : 
american pie 
the summer of raunch continu to spread into theatr with thi latest yuk fest , fill with sick joke and teen dialogu aplenti . 
if you go expect dawson 's creek , you 're in for a problem . 
if your expect are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie . 
the movi cast sever unknown , with the onli real recogniz one be sctv 's own eugen levi as a happy-go-lucki dad . 
the stori revolv around four high school senior who have one goal befor the school year get out- get laid . 
that 's pretti much it . 
throughout the movi , littl sick comic bit are sprinkl throughout , includ a memor scene involv an appl pie ( i wo n't give it away , but you probabl know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribl awri . 
of cours , the movi ha some slightli sentiment bit , but they do n't drag the movi 's humor content down that bad . 
most of the actor get their job done , but it 's levi who 's a hoot , a father who tri to talk sex with hi son with the help of some curiou `` visual aid `` . 
i could n't stop laugh dure thi movi , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex refer , then american pie is for you . 
if you 're one of those `` conserv `` type , well , i 'll bet you 're have fun at home while thi , south park , and austin power ii play in theatr , now are n't you ?
