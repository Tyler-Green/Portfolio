recent i read 4 review of pleasantville-on from entertain weekli , one from a newsgroup , and two from differ onlin resourc . 
each review compar thi film to the truman show . 
whi ? 
the onli reason peopl compar pleasantvil to truman is due to the fact that their live are on televis . 
other than that , the two movi are complet differ from each other . 
review seem to love to pick one movi ( i . e . 
the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guidelin for other movi . 
when pleasantvil and edtv open , all critic seem to treat the two film like they were subject of king truman . 
the same goe for the thin red line , as well . 
when it open in decemeb , probabl 98 % of review compar it to stephen spielberg 's save privat ryan , give thin line no chanc whatsoev . 
critic love privat ryan so much , that they automat decid no movi is good enough to reach it standard . 
thi is whi i think pleasantvil wa underr . 
if the truman show had never been made , pleasantvil probabl would have receiv better review , done better at the box offic , and would be rememb after it 's long been on the video store shelv . 
sure , it wa n't perfect , and it wa n't veri believ , but neither wa the wizard of oz or star war , and there stand two of the most promin movi in histori . 
with the except of don knott as the annoy `` tv repairman `` the film is cast perfectli : the ice storm 's tobey maguir is david in real life ; he watch the old 50 's sitcom `` pleasantvil `` to escap from hi feud parent . 
hi twin sister , jen ( rees witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotyp ) smoke and wear reveal cloth . 
but what make her charact believ is the dialogue-thos excess 90 's term such as `` like `` , `` whatev `` , and `` cool `` make her sound like the total dimwit she 's suppos to be . 
the twin , with a littl help from a tv repairman ( cast don knott in thi role wa obvious a cameo-esqu cast rather than a true act one ) , are suck into pleasantvil by a magic new remot . 
their new parent , play by william h . maci and joan allen , are perfect in everi way . 
their new name are bud and mari sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantvil . 
after the sibl fit comfort in their new role , the movi begin to take form . 
it 's just like watch a sitcom in itself ; you do n't want it to end . 
`` mari sue `` ha sex with her date , the school basketbal champion ; when he tell all hi friend about it , they stop preform perfectli at basketbal , and thing start to take color . 
soon we learn that these peopl do n't know how to express true emot , and when they learn to do so , they eventu turn into color . 
thi eventu spark a racial war between the `` color `` and the `` black & white . `` 
entertain weekli review lisa schwarzbaum claim the movi ha , `` none of the depth , poignanc , and brillianc of the truman show . . . `` 
ye , the truman show wa mayb a littl more intellig . 
but the racial setting-intensifi by the forc of the color to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainli classifi as deep , consid it 's what i least expect . 
gari ross did not tri to creat an intellig , award masterpiece-h just tri to convey moral messag within hi work . 
take for exampl big and dave , hi past film . 
big-b care what you wish for . 
dave-good or bad lie is still lie . 
did these movi win big award ? 
no , but they won the heart of million . 
pleasantvil could have done that too , if it wa n't for snotti review who set preced with preceed film . 
pleasantvil : a- ad2am `` i almost lost my nose . . . and 
i like it . 
i like breath through it . ``
