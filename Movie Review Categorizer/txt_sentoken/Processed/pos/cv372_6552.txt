okay , let me first say , thi is a beavi and butthead movi . 
if you do not like beavi and butthead , do not go to see thi movi ! ! ! ! ! 
howev , if you do like them , i recommen you get out right now and go see it . 
the movi start off with the boy wonder what happen to their tv . 
they notic that it ha been stolen and they vow to find it . 
thi wind their way through america search for dalla ( she is a woman ) . 
they look for her becaus as they are search for the tv , they find a drunk who want them `` to do `` hi wife . 
well , of cours they think he want them to score with her when actual he want them to kill her . 
and the fun start their . 
thi movi is a mix of funni gag that anli beavi and butthead could pull off . 
it is qualiti entertain that onli fan of beavi and butthead would enjoy . 
i enjoy thi movi alot becaus mike judg knew how to keep pace . 
even when they were crawl through the desert and i thought the movi start to lag , he manag to keep the laugh come . 
if you expect chang from the show keep look . 
the same charact , the same voic , the same everyth from the show and that 's what make it good . 
you might think with a movi from a tv show , you can chang a few thing . 
often time thi spell disast for film becaus the film maker veer away from what made the show popular in the first place !
