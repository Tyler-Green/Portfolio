steve soderbergh 's `` sex , lie , and videotap , `` which won the grand prize at the cann film festiv in 1989 , arguabl began the resurg of independ film . 
made on a shoestr budget of $ 1 . 2 million , with then rel unknown actor , it is a provoc , thoroughli origin drama . 
the film mostli focus on the four central charact , all in their late 20's-earli 30 's . 
ann ( andi macdowel ) , an unfulfil housewif , is marri to john ( peter gallagh ) , an insensit lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is have an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . 
complic matter even wors is graham ( jame spader , who won best actor at cann ) , john 's old colleg buddi , who come to stay at their hous . 
ann is absolut won over by him , even though she clearli ha state that she ha veri littl interest in sex . 
that is the set-up for the last hour of the pictur , and sinc the film is entitl , `` sex , lie , and videotap , `` it is best to keep the rest of the stori develop at bay so that they will come as a genuin surpris . 
director steven soderbergh ha proven to be a wildli offbeat filmmak , rang from the independ , to the mainstream ( 1998 's `` out of sight `` ) , to the downright kafkaesqu ( 1997 's `` schizopoli `` ) . 
he is the type of director who obvious take a lot of chanc , and believ in the work that he doe , and , `` sex , lie , and videotap , `` is probabl hi most confid , and mayb even best , to date . 
the perform are superb from all four lead , but macdowel stand out in what is probabl the main charact . 
she is alway a veri win actress , but thi is probabl her most three-dimension role that she ha had ( with a close second be altman 's 1993 mosaic , `` short cut `` ) . 
the other part are perfectli cast as well , from spader 's omin graham , to gallagh 's self-involv john , to giacomo 's outspoken cynthia . 
the final act of the film , especi , come right out of left field , and turn out to be both shock and oddli touch , and it would be crimin to give away the film 's secret . 
suffic to say that , through one power sequenc , ann is abl to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learn a valuabl lesson about honesti , as well as decept . 
the film ha one fault , howev . 
the charact are almost all emot cold and isol from one anoth , and often unlik . 
if there had been a few extra scene with gallagh , it probabl would have help , sinc hi relationship with macdowel is n't quit as explor as i would have like . 
`` sex , lie , and videotap , `` although minorli flaw , is still easili a brave and adult motion pictur that is far more matur and honest about it subject matter than the usual film . 
soderbergh clearli knew what he wa do while he wa make it , and the final product certainli prove thi .
