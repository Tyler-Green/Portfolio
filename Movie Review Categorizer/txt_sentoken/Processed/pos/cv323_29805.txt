thi is the best british gangster film sinc the long good friday . 
jon bennet ( play by andrew howard ) is an extrem good assassin . 
as such he is probabl an evil man but it doe not worri him . 
he ha becom an unquest weapon . 
he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is . 
but even assassin have innoc past . 
he run into an old from school day and he is marri to a mutual girl friend from school . 
complic matter is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime . 
a big piec of what make thi film work is the depict of the kingpin . 
calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequent seen in the us . 
he wa seen in the world is not enough . 
here he creat one of the best screen villain in recent year . 
he is at onc seduct and repel like a beauti venom snake . 
hi lair is underground , appar in a sewer , where he live like the king of sewer rat . 
it is the kingpin who pull the string that will control bennet 's life . 
paul sarossi who direct spent most of hi career as a cinematograph and like the kingpin 's lair , he ha mold imag of class and style out of the dark . 
by use semi-dark and let the color of deep blue and black domin everi scene he make the film visual as omin as anyth in thi nether world . 
thi is a world that is cold and unfriendli . 
sorossi creat a world of violenc much more by what we hear than what we see . 
thi is a film with a great deal of physic violenc occur just out of reach . 
we see veri littl but we hear a great deal more and we imagin more than that . 
the screenplay is by peter waddington base on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossi 's film all the way . 
it creat indel imag of evil . 
i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale . 
( i do hope they do not use the taglin `` do n't mess with mr . in-between . `` )
