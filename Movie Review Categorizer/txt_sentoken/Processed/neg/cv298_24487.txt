it 's tough to be an aspir superhero in champion citi . 
just ask mr . furiou ( ben stiller ) , the blue raja ( hank azaria ) , and the shovel ( william h . maci ) . 
they 're tri to break into the biz , but captain amaz ( greg kinnear ) , the citi 's hero numero uno , hog all the action . 
the good captain ha hi own problem . 
becaus he 's all but elimin crime , amaz 's endors deal are fall through . 
the public crave a major slugfest , so amaz engin the parol of hi one-tim arch enemi casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) . 
frankenstein succe beyond expect ; he captur capt . amaz befor set out on hi scheme to destroy the citi . 
so , no one is left to save the day but our would-b superhero , but their abil are more `` littl leagu `` than `` justic leagu . `` 
the raja hurl fork at foe , the shovel hit them with a shovel , and mr . furiou just yell at peopl ( stiller is do essenti the same charact he play in a guest appear on `` friend `` ) . 
after a pain first strike , the guy hold audit for teammat and add the bowler ( janean garofalo ) , who carri her dead father 's skull in her bowl ball ; invis boy ( kel mitchel ) , who can onli use hi power when no one is look at him ; the spleen ( paul reuben ) , who blow devast wind from hi rear ; and the sphinx ( we studi ) , a mysteri figur who will teach them to fight . 
`` mysteri men `` boast one of the most talent and eclect cast ever assembl . 
in addit to those alreadi mention , the credit includ lena olin as frankenstein 's evil shrink , comedian eddi izzard and the fuge ' prakazrel michel as disco-them thug , singer tom wait as an inventor of superhero weapon , arti lang ( from `` mad tv `` ) as anoth thug , clair forlani ( from `` meet joe black `` ) as a waitress mr . furiou is pursu , louis lasser ( from `` mari hartman , mari hartman `` ) as the blue raja 's mother , and actor/magician ricki jay as capt . amaz 's manag . 
the cast includ four oscar-nomin actor ! 
when i saw the list of player earli last year , i figur the result would be a can't-miss comedi . 
yet , i must report disappoint . 
the script is probabl the worst of 1999 . 
nearli everi joke misfir . 
the stab at comic book are too obviou to be funni . 
( for exampl , no one can recogn capt . amaz in hi secret ident becaus he 's wear glass . ) 
the fart joke surround the spleen are surprisingli the onli gag that work . 
the cast tri hard , especi hank azaria , whose charact adopt an effet british accent while in costum , but the script is just too lame to run .
