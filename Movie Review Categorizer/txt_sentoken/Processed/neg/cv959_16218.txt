`` viru `` is a monster movi without a monster . 
ani movi with a hurdl that larg to overcom had better be pretti damn good otherwis . 
sadli , `` viru `` doe not deliv , on ani level . 
the movi open with the russian space station mir about to transmit someth ( we never find out what ) to a big boat with lot of satellit on it . 
sudddenli , a wave of color lightn come fli through space , and wind up destroy mir and use it to transmit itself to the aforement big boat . 
cut to seven day later , we meet donald sutherland and hi band of seafar vultur . 
see , they spend all their time sail around look for dead-in-the-wat ship to rescu , and then collect the reward money . 
at least , i * think * that 's what they do . 
along with mani other thing in the film , their reason for be out in the middl of the ocean is n't realli explain . 
so , they stumbl upon thi big boat with lot of satellit on it , and decid to haul it back to russian water . 
the onli problem is , the crew start disappear one-by-on and turn into borg . 
ye , borg . 
complet with the red laser beam in place of an eye . 
appar , thi alien lifeform can onli surviv if insid someth electr . 
so , it creat make-shift machin and use human for `` spare part `` . 
blah , blah , blah . 
i could go on forev describ the ludicr so-cal plot , but i wo n't . 
suffic it to say the most origin thing about thi movi is have donald sutherland play an irish man ( ! ) . 
everyth els in thi movi ha been taken from other ( better ) movi . 
for exampl , mani of the machin resembl those found in the little-seen japanes movi , `` tetsuo-th iron man `` . 
and the plot is right out of `` alien `` . 
the funni thing is , i wa actual expect to enjoy thi movi . 
i have a soft spot for cheesi monster movi , like last year under-appreci `` deep rise `` . 
but `` viru `` , as i mention earlier , doe n't even have a monster . 
it just ha a big pile of circuit and wire and expect the audienc to fear thi ridicul look contrapt . 
`` viru `` is the type of movi that realli make you wonder what the screenwrit wa think about when he wrote it . 
besid the lame `` monster `` , it 's chock full of dialogu that no real person would ever say , and situat that no real person would ever allow themselv to get into . 
for exampl , there is a scene late in the movi in which one of the charact actual attempt to * negoti * with the alien ! 
now , i do n't know about you , but if i came upon a lifeform that view mankind as a viru to be elimin , i doubt that i would attempt to reason with it . 
that make about as much sens as a babi squirrel calmli ask a fierc predat to spare hi life . 
final , `` viru `` is n't scari . 
the least the filmmak could have done wa to make the movi just a littl scari . 
as it is , it 's about as frighten as a box of cooki . 
skip `` viru `` . 
if it 's a cool monster movi you want , rent the far superior ( and the granddaddi of thi genr ) `` alien `` .
