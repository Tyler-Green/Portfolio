do n't let thi movi fool you into believ the romant noir of william shakespear . 
no one will truli understand the heart and soul of thi man except through hi work , and thi movi make a vain attempt at that . 
ani move to ? glamoris ' hi life , which hollywood ha an annoy tendenc to do , will onli subtract from hi achiev rather than expound on hi great . 
thi movi about hi life , although well written , put too much make-up on a man whose life wa probabl more pork and potato , rather than lobster and champagn . 
oh well , let 's fantasis onward an assum that he wa a bit of a flirtati play-writ , who fall in love with a beauti woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspir , sever play develop - ? romeo and juliet ' , and ? the twelfth night ' . 
it is easier for me to believ that he had a wet dream and that 's how all hi play develop , but pleas spare me all of thi unnecessari melodrama . 
but i guess my version probabl would n't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen . 
so is there ani justif in romanticis the man shakespear , when all we need to do is read hi work in order to find hi soul . 
i think not . 
as for the oscar were they deserv by thi movi ? 
i think not . 
in mani aspect ? privat ryan ' and ? life is beauti ' were far superior movi , but one should never assum that thi should be a criteria for win an oscar , as time and again , for reason unexplain , an undeserv movi will win the accolad . 
anoth sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best femal lead , over a more polish cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfath die and your nephew be hospitalis - peopl will start feel sorri for you .
