tomb raider . 
fun ? 
excit ? 
challeng ? 
given the unpreced popular ( especi among teenag boy ) of the video game that sport an uber-buff , pistol packin ' babe who raid , well . . . 
tomb , you have to believ it 's these three thing and more ! 
`` lara croft : tomb raider , `` the big screen variant of said video game , which featur a pumped-up angelina joli ( the oscar ? winner for `` girl , interrupt `` no less ) in the titl role is , howev , none of these thing . 
it is n't fun , it is n't excit , and the onli challeng is see how long you can stay in your seat ( i suffer through to the bitter , bitter end ; the wife opt for barn & nobl at the 45-minut mark ) . 
direct by simon west with the same subtleti he brought to `` con air , `` `` tomb raider `` is an empty-head , big budget bore . 
the stori borrow unintellig from that mother of all turkey `` hudson hawk `` ( the same hokum about planetari align and sacr stone that , when brought togeth , well . . . 
who the heck care ? ) and it make `` super mario bro . `` ( bob hoskin ' ill-advis career move ) look like `` rocco and hi brother `` ( that classic of italian neo-real ) . 
i 'll go out on a limb here and say i suspect there 's actual more charact develop in the video game than the movi proper . 
thi is where the joli defenders/video game nut jump in and say thi movi is n't about charact develop it 's about kick seriou butt ( or bum , sinc ms . croft hail from england 's green and pleasant ) . 
with lip , breast , and bicep all inflat to the max , lara croft is all about postur , and joli ha a hard time simpli stand still without tri to look tough . 
ok , let 's forget challeng . 
should n't `` tomb raider `` be , at the veri least , fun and excit ? 
should n't our butt-kick heroin also encompass the sophist of , say , jame bond with the wit of indiana jone ? 
there 's no humor to be found anywher in `` tomb raider , `` even though it tri hard from time to time . 
even `` the mummi return `` did n't take itself too serious . 
the villain here is notic lack , the special effect are ridicul overblown and unnecessarili complic , and the script is non-exist . 
to liven thing up ( perhap ) , joli 's live father jon voight put in a few minut as lara 's dead father lord croft ; talk about a stretch . 
one thing i had n't expect from the film is that joli affect a slightli better english accent than her pa ( although i suspect that thin-look moustach he 's forc to wear get in the way some ) . 
unsuccess ? not entir . 
if anyth , `` lara croft : tomb raider `` make you want to check out the video game itself to figur out exactli what all the fuss wa about .
