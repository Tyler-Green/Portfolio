`` quest for camelot `` is warner bro . ' first feature-length , fully-anim attempt to steal clout from disney 's cartoon empir , but the mous ha no reason to be worri . 
the onli other recent challeng to their throne wa last fall 's promis , if flaw , 20th centuri fox product `` anastasia , `` but disney 's `` hercul , `` with it live cast and color palat , had her beat hands-down when it came time to crown 1997 's best piec of anim . 
thi year , it 's no contest , as `` quest for camelot `` is pretti much dead on arriv . 
even the magic kingdom at it most mediocr -- that 'd be `` pocahonta `` for those of you keep score -- is n't nearli as dull as thi . 
the stori revolv around the adventur of free-spirit kayley ( voic by jessalyn gilsig ) , the early-teen daughter of a belat knight from king arthur 's round tabl . 
kayley 's onli dream is to follow in her father 's footstep , and she get her chanc when evil warlord ruber ( gari oldman ) , an ex-round tabl member-gone-bad , steal arthur 's magic sword excalibur and accident lose it in a danger , booby-trap forest . 
with the help of hunki , blind timberland-dwel garrett ( carey elw ) and a two-head dragon ( eric idl and don rickl ) that 's alway argu with itself , kayley just might be abl to break the mediev sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur 's side . 
`` quest for camelot `` is miss pure showmanship , an essenti element if it 's ever expect to climb to the high rank of disney . 
there 's noth here that differenti `` quest `` from someth you 'd see on ani given saturday morn cartoon -- subpar anim , instantli forgett song , poorly-integr computer footag . 
( compar kayley and garrett 's run-in with the angri ogr to herc 's battl with the hydra . 
i rest my case . ) 
even the charact stink -- none of them are remot interest , so much that the film becom a race to see which one can out-bland the other . 
in the end , it 's a tie -- they all win . 
that dragon 's comedi shtick is aw cloy , but at least it show sign of a puls . 
at least fan of the early-'90 tgif televis line-up will be thrill to find jaleel `` urkel `` white and bronson `` balki `` pinchot share the same footag . 
a few scene are nice realiz ( though i 'm at a loss to recal enough to be specif ) , and the actor provid the voic talent are enthusiast ( though most are pair up with singer who do n't sound a thing like them for their big music moment -- jane seymour and celin dion ? ? ? ) . 
but one must strain through too much of thi mess to find the good . 
asid from the fact that children will probabl be as bore watch thi as adult , `` quest for camelot `` 's most grievou error is it complet lack of person . 
and person , we learn from thi mess , goe a veri long way .
