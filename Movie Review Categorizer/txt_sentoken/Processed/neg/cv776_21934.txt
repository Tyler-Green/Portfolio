the most depress thing about the depressingli pedestrian jame bond film `` the world is not enough `` is it final frame : white letter on a black background proclaim `` jame bond will return . `` 
oh i certainli hope not . 
with pierc brosnan in hi third and reportedli last go-round as jame bond 007 , `` the world is not enough `` is the best exampl to date that `` 'enough `` is enough . 
in thi , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchis featur ian fleme 's debonair british secret agent who like hi martini -- and hi nemes -- shaken not stir , the sub-inspir screenwrit have chosen to rehash all of the setup , stunt , and sexi encount of the previou 18 bond flick rather than come up with anyth the slightest bit origin . 
we 've got previously-us speedboat chase , ski chase , and sticki situat aboard nuclear submarin . 
we 've got a coupl of hot-to-trot babe without an ounc of act abil between them . 
we 've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domin slash destruct ( here play by a skinhead robert carlyl with mean , lean panach ) . 
and , as ha been the case sinc 1977 's `` the spi who love me , `` we 've got a plot that ha noth whatsoev to do with anyth conceiv by mr . fleme . 
we 've also got a main titl song by garbag to which , with veri littl effort , you can fit the lyric to * both * song from `` tomorrow never die . `` 
while origin wa never the seri ' strong suit , the film were almost alway fun , with at least some thought go into the nonstop stunt . 
i ca n't think of one memor set-piec in the entir -- and veri dull -- `` the world is not enough . `` 
in addit , michael apt ( ye , the respect director of such film as `` coal miner 's daughter , `` `` nell , `` and the `` 28up `` documentari seri ) take embarrass advantag of the full rang of bond clich ? s . 
you get the `` talk killer `` plot devic -- you know the scenario : the bad guy ha the good guy at hi merci yet wax poetic just long enough to die of old age . 
and you get a slew of high-pric assassin who ca n't hit a barn door at 20 pace : in the film 's open minut ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chase a sultri sniper along the thame and the leather-clad love fail to hit bond 's souped-up `` fish boat `` with a bazooka when he pull within a few feet of her . 
later , she take off in a hot air balloon with bond dangl from a guy rope beneath her but is still unabl to take him out . 
these reliabl absurd are more frustrat than usual sinc there are no distract other than occasion ad for luxuri automobil , vodka , or credit card . 
in and among the rampant product placement , brosnan grappl with carlyl , `` braveheart `` 's sophi marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she 's terribl ) , `` wild thing `` ' denis richard ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she 's laughabl ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi bring the onli shred of digniti to a seri that ha long sinc jettison it self-respect ( about the time roger moor inherit bond 's walther ppk ) . 
brosnan goe through the motion with the grace and charm you 'd expect of the former `` remington steel `` star , but even he ha to be think there 's more to life than an easi paycheck . 
he 's given plenti of wiseacr asid to deliv , but onli one of them -- `` i do n't know ani doctor joke `` -- made me chuckl ( although `` i thought christma onli come onc a year `` is more in keep with the seri ' penchant for grown-worthi pun ) .
