`` it wa not scari . `` 
these are the first word that came to mind after it wa over . 
when a movi is call _vampires_ , `` not scari `` are n't word that should be associ with it . 
but that wa n't my onli gripe . 
john carpent is a name associ with cutting-edg cinema , as in the intens scare of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the princ of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escap from new york_ . 
unfortun , the onli thing that is cut edg about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movi is abl to reach . 
with an anem plot and not-quite-kosh special effect , _john carpent 's vampires_ ha bare enough substanc to slake the thirst of even the least discern genr fan . 
the film is at first concern with a group of roam vampir slayer , led by jame wood , of all peopl . 
like some sort of holi a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invad and wipe out a nest of vampir in a new mexico shack . 
their method is amusingli innov : the blood-suck are reel out with harpoon so they can flare up in the sun like matchstick . 
to commemor their victori , the loutish band decor a motel room with hooker and parti the night away . 
their celebr is short-liv , howev , as a master vampir name valek ambush and single-handedli destroy most of the team . 
wood ' jack crow and buddi montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escap with their live , along with a woman name katrina ( sheryl lee ) . 
although the woman ha been bitten , montoya and crow decid to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampir . 
the rest of the movi is concern with the boy ' hunt for valek ( thoma ian griffith ) , a freaki marilyn manson-typ who 's on a mission that date back 600 year . 
along the way they pick up a priest name guiteau ( tim guine ) , a charact who serv pretti much the same purpos as the jitteri cpl . 
upham in _save privat ryan_ . 
some stuff happen in the middl of the movi , but i ca n't rememb most of it , becaus i often found a twitch hair in the corner of the frame more interest than what wa happen on screen . 
_vampires_ final start to pick up about 90 minut into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandon prison-turn vampir nest . 
onli then doe the film begin to even resembl a carpent flick . 
but it 's too littl too late . 
we get the inevit final confront , but it seem tack on and rather anti-climact ( come on , we 're deal with _the_ master vampir here ! ) 
interestingli , last summer 's vampir action _blade_ wa deriv from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seem more steep in campi cheesi than the former , a more deliber superhero flick . 
wood ' jack crow spout glib off-the-cuff one-lin and stroll away from explod build with that oh-so-cool stride . 
and hi motiv for kill vampir ? 
take a wild guess . 
( hint : a ______ kill hi _____ when he wa just a _____ . ) 
at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylish . 
_vampires_ lack even cheap thrill to mask it gossamer-thin plot . 
to make up for thi , the movi resort to other `` shock , `` such as it gener condescend attitud toward women ( crow slap them around for the fun of it ) and an overplay contempt for religion ( crow teas guiteau incessantli about whether hi vow of celibaci ha made him prone to `` get woodi . `` ) 
it can be argu that mayb i want too much from thi movi . 
if not scari and gori , i want tens , relentless , and exhaust . 
_john carpent 's vampires_ is none of these . 
i can onli recommend it for the hardcor carpent fan . 
for the rest of you look for a good scare , bewar : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth .
