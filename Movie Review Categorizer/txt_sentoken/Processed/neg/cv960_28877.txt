dr . alan grant ( sam neill , `` jurass park `` ) is becom disillus . 
paleontolog is no longer the sexi scienc it onc wa sinc the ingen corpor clone hi subject matter . 
hi lectur bring peopl interest in hi adventur on isla nubla rather than hi research and fund dollar are dri up . 
when the kirbi ( william h . maci , `` fargo `` ; tea leoni , `` the famili man `` ) ask him to be their guid for an anniversari flyover of isla sorna ( the notori site b of `` the lost world `` ) he 's disdain , but onc they wave their checkbook , he reconsid . 
howev the kirbi have n't given dr . grant their real agenda in `` jurass park iii . `` 
of cours , we , the audienc , have been tip off , given that the film begin by show us eric ( trevor morgan , `` the patriot `` ) , a young boy , and ben ( mark harelik , `` elect `` ) go for a paraglid adventur off that same island that goe awri ( and look like cheesi rear project ) . 
grant 's establish back home with a new right hand man , billi brennan ( alessandro nivola , `` love 's labour 's lost `` ) on site at a dig in montana sore lack fund . 
he also pay a visit to old flame dr . elli sattler ( laura dern , `` jurass park `` ) , now marri to anoth with a young son who call grant 'the dinosaur man ' appar for the sole purpos of dredg her up again for the film 's poorli imagin final . 
grant take billi along on the kirbi trip , which is realli an illeg gambit to save their son , that young paraglid . 
the coupl are n't millionair , make grant 's check bogu , and they 're separ as well ( eric wa with amanda 's new boyfriend , not that that make much sens ) , mean we 're in for some gooey famili dynam while wait for the dino dine . 
the kirbi hire hand ( and obviou bait ) are a threesom led by mr . udeski ( michael jeter , `` the gift `` ) . 
( did n't anyon consid that cast michael jeter and william h . maci togeth and not have them be relat wa a littl odd ? ) 
as direct by joe johnston ( `` octob sky , `` `` jumanji `` ) ( spielberg onli produc thi one ) from a risibl script by peter buchman and the `` elect `` team of alexand payn & jim taylor , `` jurass park iii `` is noth more than a quicki monster flick with a coupl of new dino ( a spinosaurau , which goe head to head with the t-rex , and pteranodon ) . 
the plot , as it were , is a seri of coincid combin with extrem leap of faith and a trifecta of stupid cell phone trick . 
the effect are no longer new , and , as shot by televis cinematograph shelli johnson , rather murki look at time . 
film edit by robert dalva ( `` octob sky `` ) wa presum done by machet , to keep thi down to a 90 minut run time . 
i know of no other reason to explain the ridicul end which featur the survivor confront a pack of raptor , then be save by the most ludicr of logic jump within a few minut . 
'origin ' music by don davi just repeat john william ' origin theme . 
while neill and young morgan attempt to inject some humor and human into the proceed , the rest of the cast are plod unexcept . 
`` jurass park iii `` will probabl provid some quick entertain for those who go into it know what to expect , the same crowd who mayb like `` the lost world : jurass park . ``
