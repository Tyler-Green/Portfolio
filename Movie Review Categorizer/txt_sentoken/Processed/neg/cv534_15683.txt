although i had not been a viewer of the `` rugrat `` televis seri , i went into their first anim featur film , `` the rugrat movi , `` with a posit attitud . 
the trailer look cute enough , after all . 
after see it , i think the word in my recent `` antz `` review , in which i state that it wa the worst film of it type sinc 1995 's `` the pebbl and the penguin , `` were a bit prematur . 
`` the rugrat movi , `` is bottom-of-the-barrel children 's fare at it worst , and start to make , `` antz `` look good in comparison . 
as in the show , `` the rugrat movi , `` is about a group of veri littl friend , rang from babi to a three-year-old . 
the head of the group , tommi pickl ( e . g . 
daili ) , becom distraught when hi mother ha a newborn babi name dill ( get it ? 
dill pickl ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is inform by hi three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babi alway take all of the attent away from the other children . 
when the other children , chucki , and twin lil and phil , suggest take dill back to the hospit , tommi goe along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and becom lost , run into wolv and circu monkey , among other thing . 
`` the rugrat movi , `` judg from the idea of be lost in the wood , could have been a potenti fun famili film , and there were mani differ thing that could have been done with the stori . 
so what did the writer choos to do ? 
whi , they set up a protract , clich scene where the children almost go over a waterfal , of cours ! 
for the youngest of children ( age 3-7 ) , `` the rugrat movi , `` may veri well entertain them , judg from the audienc i saw thi with . 
of cours , if you look around at all of the older kid and their parent , they were all desper struggl to stay awak , and that includ me . 
for an adult , `` the rugrat movi , `` is a piec of garbag . 
the plotlin is unorigin and the write ha absolut no wit or charm . 
there is n't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there ani excit . 
if anyth is even margin good in the pictur , it is the bright anim style , so it is especi unfortun that it wa n't to servic a more qualiti film . 
`` the rugrat movi `` is doa from the start . 
i am all for a worthwhil famili movi , but sometim an anim film come along that is simpli aw . 
as said befor , young children may like it , but even they deserv better than thi . 
for adult , it is a nearli unbear , excruci chore to sit through . 
as for me , `` the rugrat movi , `` is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deepli hate , but it is the most bore . 
parent : do yourselv a favor and take your kid to see the rereleas of , `` the wizard of oz . `` 
that is a pictur that contain a great deal of magic and wonder , two thing of which , `` the rugrat movi , `` is complet miss .
