instinct is the kind of movi that inexperienc moviego will undoubtedli label as `` power `` or `` touch `` . 
i have a name for it myself : `` gross `` . 
thi is the sort of film where somebodi stand up to a bulli , the bulli look at the `` rebel `` threateningli , about to hurt him , and then everyon els whom the bulli ha heretofor control stand up too . 
how that scene is still present in so mani movi today appal me : are n't present day moviego beyond be `` inspir `` by someth like that ? 
thi is one exampl ( there are actual some more in instinct alon ) of filmmak insult the audienc 's intellig . 
instinct 's plot is brim with potenti : world-renown anthropologist ethan powel ( anthoni hopkin ) disappear for two year whilst do research in the jungl of africa . 
he wa found and is come back to the unit state a convict killer ; he murder to african policemen who were allegedli tri to captur him . 
after commit a few more brutal act of violenc in the airport , the author stick him in a prison 's `` psychot ward `` . 
assign to do an evalu on powel is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba good jr . ) . 
caulder start out do the evalu mere for the purpos of further hi career . 
of cours ( and no mainstream filmmak would ever have it ani other way ) he start realli care for powel and he becom fix on help powel prove that he is not a psychot and that he should not be in prison . 
and then there 's the inevit `` heartless meani `` charact , in the form of donald sutherland who play caulder 's mentor . 
he care for caulder but doe everyth he can to discourag him from help powel . 
let 's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantli incompet psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off . 
ani good shrink will listen to what hi patient ha to say no matter the subject becaus ani good shrink will learn a great deal about hi patient that way . 
not good old theo . 
no , he ask purpos point question and when powel dare to ventur to anoth subject caulder say `` we need to talk about thi right now . `` 
thi is a flaw onli in the sens that it detract from instinct 's alreadi dubiou credibl ; unfortun it 's also the least of it problem . 
director jon turteltaub , who made the delight john travolta vehicl phenomenon as well as the surprisingli above-par cool run decid to make thi movi so shamelessli sentiment that , contrari to what thi movi 's promot would have you believ , it ha much more in common with patch adam than with the silenc of the lamb . 
it 's not the kind of sentiment that can almost bring tear to your eye ( what dream may come aptli demonstr that ) but the kind that bring vomit up your esophagu ( excus the graphic depict ) . 
it aim to `` inspir `` rather than to touch heart . 
as yoda would say , inspir it doe not . 
it is the ultim sign of futil when a screenwrit ( the veri experienc gerald di pego ) ha to resort to liter tell the audienc a movi 's stori . 
inde , somewher in the begin of instinct , one of the charact actual read aloud the film 's plot to anoth charact . 
thi , like the instanc i mention in the first paragraph of thi review , is a horrid insult to our intellig . 
i am forc to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figur out what instinct is about simpli from regular convers . 
i think that anthoni hopkin is one of the greatest screen actor , and he chew the sceneri in thi movi , brilliant as ever . 
oscar winner cuba good jr . on the other hand is dread . 
hi perform is at least part of what make hi charact seem so incap of be a shrink . 
i like the guy in jerri maguir as well as in as good as it get but here he fail to project ani shred of credibl or real feel . 
i love anim , and instinct 's promin save the gorillas/l in harmoni with natur theme is certainli someth i could sympath with . 
howev thi movi 's execut is complet unaccept . 
tone down the violenc and thi will be a chick flick .
