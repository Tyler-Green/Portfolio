sean conneri star as a harvard law professor who head back into the courtroom , by way of the everglad , to defend a young , educ black man ( blair underwood ) . 
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and say that hi confess wa coerc from the region 's tough , black cop ( lawrenc fishburn ) . 
watch conneri and fishburn bump head for two hour is amus enough , but the plot 's a joke . 
there 's no logic at work here . 
tone is also an issu -- there is none . 
director arn glimcher never establish exactli what hi film is tri to say . 
is it a statement on human right ? 
is it a knock-off of silenc of the lamb ? 
glimcher never tell . 
instead , he forc hi charact to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridg after drawbridg , hope that the audienc wo n't notic what 's miss . 
just aw . 
the mad of king georg 107 min . 
/ not rate ========================== 
still wonder who nigel hawthorn is ? 
then check out hi oscar- nomin work in the mad of king georg , still play in both raleigh and chapel hill . 
stage director nichola hytner , in a remark screen debut , ha adapt alan bennett 's 1991 tragic comedi to fine effect . 
sumptuous-look and onli mildli stuffi , the film chart the mad that plagu king georg iii ( hawthorn ) almost 30 year into hi reign . 
a man of no import 98 min . 
/ rate `` r `` ====================== 
in suri krishnamma 's a man of no import , albert finney disappear so deepli into the role of a lovabl dublin bu conductor that it 's a shame when the film get so seriou around him . 
hi charact is a conductor with a passion for oscar wild . 
he read to hi rider , and onc a year , with their help , he tri to stage one of the author 's play . 
thi year it 's `` salom . `` 
for about an hour , there 's a sweet magic behind finney and hi troup of working-class stiff . 
conflict aris , but it 's small stuff -- an administr from the bu compani here , an outrag cathol pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there . 
but with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film roll smoothli over these plot point -- just like the gorgeou leland double-deck bu in the stori . 
where thing get seriou is toward the end of the film , when the plot take a turn that the bu never would , and the stori head down a veri dark alley that mark the end of an enjoy ride . 
the twist make sens -- and help paint a complet pictur of finney 's charact -- but the trip to get there betray the light , airi atmospher of what had come befor . 
it 's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it doe n't send the stori soar into the realm of incredul . 
it 's just a turn off . 
dr . strangelov 93 min . 
/ not rate =============== 
mein fuhrer ! 
the most fun that * i * had last month wa in durham , at the carolina , at a mid-week screen of stanley kubrick 's pitch-black comedi dr . 
strangelov ( or how i learn to stop worri and love the bomb ) . 
the 1964 film star peter seller ( in three role ) , georg c . scott , sterl hayden , and slim picken . 
their antic brought the hous down , which , to my surpris , wa pack by an audienc younger than the film .
