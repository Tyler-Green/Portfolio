well i guess it 's that time of the year again . 
the one time of the year where movi craftor are exoner from the need to even * tri * write a script that ha more dialogu than explos . 
it 's also the best time for the hand of exist bigtim hollywood mr action hero to dust off their miniscul vocabulari , pull on their black vest and charg onto our screen ters expir what they hope will becom memor catchphras . 
in america they call thi time `` summer `` and it happen onc everi year . 
and mayb it 's the exposur to all that nasti sun that doe it , but in the process normal weak , insipid line like `` consid thi a divorc , `` `` hasta la vista , babi , `` and `` you 're the diseas . 
i 'm the cure `` actual do end up be repeat more often then the phrase from my book of biblic proverb . 
thi is not entir a bad thing , of cours . 
what am i talk about ? 
i 'm talk about the summer `` blockbust , `` the `` action thriller , `` the `` this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go `` explos , ga threat , fli saucer , and special effect . 
in the rash of `` my , what big gun you have , but wait ! 
mine are bigger `` movi , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environ movi ( or whale , whatev ) , and * thi * year , the odd crop of `` save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threat `` offer . 
i 'm talk about the three batman , the speed , the termin , etc . thi year i 'm talk about twister , independ day , the arriv , the rock , mission : imposs , and of cours , eras . 
here in singapor , as our local movi critic like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of `` my explos is more real-look than your `` movi , but noth els . 
mission : imposs open in our theatr almost as soon as it did in the us . 
the same goe for eras , which is unfortun for arnold schwarzenegg becaus come so soon after what time magazin recent call `` mission : unavoid `` ( on account of it worldwid mega-advertis blitz ) , eras seem like a cheaper , less thought imit . 
that 's say a lot , becaus mi the movi wa alreadi a cheap , thoughtless imit of it tv origin of the '60s/'70 . 
in eras , arni is a us feder marshal who reloc trial wit whose testimoni place their live in danger . 
he doe thi by destroy all evid of their present exist and re-situ them with new ident . 
hi new case is lee cullen , play by vanessa william who , unlik all the other scumbag he 's ever reloc , is `` an actual , real life honest person . `` 
becaus she 's so good , and ha such nice leg , arnold spend the whole movi tri to protect her , and onli use the open movi sequenc to save robert pastorelli from * hi * killer . 
lee obtain evid that the high-technolog weapon compani she work for is secretli sell sophist , black-market arm to peopl with foreign accent and stringi hair . 
of cours , as the formula goe , her reveal thi inform will destroy the system as we know it becaus heck , there are peopl in high place who will go down with thi , becaus ye , thi is the biggest conspiraci in the histori of the world ( that is , america ) sinc waterg . 
in protect lee , arnold is frame by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nice play by jame caan , and end up have to prove that he is n't the one kill the programm 's wit in addit to make sure lee is n't accident torpedo- to death by the new , green gun hi enemi all have . 
it 's around thi time that peopl in the theatr with me start hum the mission : imposs theme , becaus arni 's mission includ break into a high-secur build to run a disk . 
i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyon in thi movi is so antsi about . 
it 's an electro-magnet puls gun thing which fire aluminium missil , and which can see through wall . 
it ha some sort of x-ray vision , so it user can target the victim 's heart even from great distanc . 
despit thi , which i figur is a pretti cool featur in a gun ( though i 'm certainli no expert ) , howev , arnold , whose own heart is target a number of time , * never * goe fli 10 feet backward with a two-foot missil through hi chest like all the other who get shot by thi gun . 
instead he outrun and outsmart hi tracker each time , give eeri and iron reson to that termin line that practic made him famou : `` i 'll be back . `` 
like everyon els in the theater , i left the movi feel that the trailer had dupe me , becaus they made me want to watch thi movi voluntarili . 
although there is a * lot * of violenc in thi movi , not to mention mutil and some bloodi tussl with allig , i recommend thi movi to most over-18 who need some therapeut mindless action to get over the weird of fargo or the hangov effect of leav la vega . 
review 's rate system : * wait for the video . 
* * a littl creaki , but still better than stay at home with gotcha ! 
* * * pretti good , bring a friend . 
* * * * amaz , potent stuff . 
* * * * * perfect . 
see it twice .
