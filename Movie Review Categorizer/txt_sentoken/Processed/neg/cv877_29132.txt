how could a g-rate disney film base on meg cabot 's novel `` the princess diari `` be anyth but cute , harmless fun ? 
easi . 
take all the cute , harmless fun out of it . 
and while you 're at it make it borrr-r . 
that 's what director garri marshal , screenwrit gina wendko and , not to be outdon , produc whitney houston have done with the g-rate disney film `` the princess diari . `` 
you could n't tell it from the audienc though , a braintre , mass . of grow , glow pre-pubesc girl ( and the odd parent , popcorn perch about their person ) , who posit cheer when the end credit roll ( ah the film had struck a love nerv with them but not with fuddy-duddi old me ) . 
well , i might have cheer that the utter tripe wa now well and truli over , but that would have been too obviou . 
too obviou is the least of the problem with marshal 's film ( garri made a coupl of other `` princess `` movi -- `` pretti woman `` and `` runaway bride `` -- but thi one 's way without julia robert so mayb * that 's * it problem ) . 
in addit to be predict as molass , `` the princess diari `` ha hardli got a laugh in it ( it 's a comedi ) , could bore the pant off an abyssinian for long , long stretch , and is so sloppili edit the princip refer to scene we have n't even seen yet ( and probabl never will except , perhap , in the dvd edit ) . 
marshal should take virtual all of the blame here , sinc he 's been at thi for some time and should know when a scene or two is n't work . . . 
and hardli * ani * of `` the princess diari `` work ( `` work , `` ala , impli clever and there 's none of that here either ) . 
newcom ann hathaway star as mia thermopoli , a bright but social invis san franciscan teen who learn that her singl mom ( a wacki artist play by the likabl carolin goodal ) had a bit of a fling with some royal member of some miniscul european countri nobodi ever heard of ( the filmmak go out of their way * not * to call it serbia , which is pretti much what all miniscul european countri are call in the movi mark my word ) and now she , mia , is next in line to rule `` genovia `` ( henc the headphones/tiara combo in the print ad ) . 
juli andrew , with the lumin factor crank to 11 , play mia 's grandmoth ( aka queen clariss renaldi ) , who show up out of the royal blue and lend mia much advic and direct in the eat , talk , and look like a princess depart ( although mia 's big makeov simpli transform her from ugli duckl to ugli swan ) . 
doe queen juli lose her digniti for the sake of a good laugh ? 
not realli . 
consum a corn dog is about the worst that it get . 
also on stereotyp hand are a brainless jock , an evil cheerlead , a dorky-look best friend ( `` welcom to the dollhous `` 's heather matarazzo ) , a sensit auto mechanic/musician , and marshal mainstay hector elizondo as joe the driver , impart wit and wisdom from the front seat of mia 's chauffeur-driven limousin at everi intersect . 
a non-anim g-rate movi is a rariti these day but the rate here reflect the fact that all the gut , all the good stuff , ha been exorcis from the finish product . 
lame , labor , and lament , `` the princess diari `` is recommend for eight-and-a-half year old of the feminin persuas * onli * ; all other would do well to avoid it ( like pothol , the plagu , and `` the perfect storm `` ) .
