so , it 's thirti year later , and oscar and felix are togeth again . 
that might have been an excit notion if it wa n't for the fact that the `` odd coupl `` of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunit in sever recent movi : 1993 's `` grumpi old men , `` 1995 's `` grumpier old men , `` and 1997 's `` out to sea `` ( i . e . 
`` grumpiest old men `` ) . 
so , `` the odd coupl ii `` ( i . e . 
`` the grumpiest old men of all , realli `` ) seem just anoth entri in a tire seri . 
the plot is even similar to that of `` grumpi old men `` in that lemmon and matthau 's mismatch charact are brought togeth by a romanc between their children . 
oscar 's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix 's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are get marri , and former roommat felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decid to share a car . 
. 
. 
then hilar ensu . 
well , a few chuckl ensu anyway . 
neil simon , the award-win playwright who creat oscar and felix , provid the screenplay , which is a shock , becaus the script is a piec of talentless hackwork from begin to end . 
unlik the origin play/movi , `` odd coupl ii `` doe n't find it humor in the person conflict of it charact . 
instead , it depend upon a seri of humor situat : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggl mexican over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husband ( the women are play by christin baranski of `` cybil `` and jean smart of `` design women `` ) , and hitch a ride with a man who die in the desert . 
the origin 1968 movi `` the odd coupl `` remain a classic comedi . 
it introduc the motif of roommate-as-spous that ha provid gag for movi and sitcom ever sinc . 
it wa the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debut in 1966 's `` the fortun cooki `` ) , and they made a coupl more worthwhil comedi , `` the front page `` ( 1974 ) and `` buddi buddi `` ( 1981 ) , befor go their separ way . 
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in `` grumpi old men `` six year ago wa delight , and it sequel seem appropri becaus it tie up some loos end from the first movi . 
but `` out to sea `` and `` the odd coupl ii `` are just beat a grumpi old hors . 
( you can add lemmon 's `` my fellow american , `` i . e . 
`` grumpi old presid , `` to that list , too . ) 
let 's hope that hollywood offer these two actor someth fresh to do . 
let 's hope also that we see neil simon 's name on movi that do it justic ( thi is hi first sinc 1993 's `` lost in yonker `` ) .
