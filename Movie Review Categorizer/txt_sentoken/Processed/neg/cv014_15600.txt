she wa the femm in `` la femm nikita . `` 
he wa the baldwin in `` backdraft , `` `` sliver , `` and `` fair game `` ( with cindi crawford ) . 
togeth , ann parillaud and william baldwin conspir to make `` shatter imag `` the biggest piec of hooey sinc the stallone/ston `` thriller `` `` the specialist . `` 
the film pose the question `` what if the life you 're live now is realli a dream , and your dream realiti ? `` 
it 's either about a woman who 's haunt by a recur ( and recur and recur ) nightmar that she 's a hire assassin , or it 's about a hire assassin who 's haunt by a recur ( and recur and recur ) nightmar that she 's honeymoon with william baldwin in jamaica . 
it doe n't much matter and believ me by the time `` shatter imag `` run it pain and pedestrian cours you wo n't care . 
these two live , with parillaud look like siouxsi sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eye , and black leather cloth in the seattle-bas assassin scene , and mope around like karen carpent in the jamaica scene , play out endlessli throughout the film and the result is it 's now * twice * as bore as it might have been . 
it 's not that complic plot ca n't be entertain . 
of cours it help if you have interest charact , crisp dialogu , and a modicum of style . 
`` shatter imag `` is n't complex , it 's just stupid . 
and bore . 
parillaud and baldwin , who are n't exactli shakespearean materi to begin with , are saddl with such leaden dialogu that their charact have zero chanc of break free of their cardboard confin . 
line like : 
`` you do n't beg , you insist . 
i like that in a woman . `` 
that 's parillaud 's charact talk . . . 
to her cat ! 
and : 
`` you 're not the reason i could n't care less about you . `` 
huh ? 
and thi wonder bathroom interchang earli in the film : 
`` if you give me a coupl of minut you know i 'll charm the pant off you . `` 
`` i do n't have that kind of time . `` 
talk of pant , parillaud ha her cloth off faster than you can say `` point of no return . `` 
we have come to expect thi from billi baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learn someth about their charact first . 
but there 's noth to learn . 
karen is as interest as a cereal box , a someone's-out-to-get-m crybabi who imagin the voic at the other end of the phone , the stranger who send her flower , mayb even her husband himself , is her would-b killer . 
siouxsi is the chromium cool , tough-as-nail crack kill machin who shoot out a coupl of mirror in order to justifi the film 's meaningless stock titl . 
baldwin seem more interest in parillaud 's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradis and put up a park lot ) than he doe in her . 
each time graham green show up he get kill . 
barbet schroeder ( `` revers of fortun `` ) co-produc and should be asham of himself . 
everi now and again it 's fun to watch a realli bad movi . 
and everi now and again , as `` shatter imag `` make agonizingli clear , it is n't .
