the abov is dialogu from thi film , taken almost complet in context , and not jazz up a bit to make it more inept than it is . 
it is spoken between two of the protagonist somewher in the film , and basic serv as a perfect exampl of what thi film is about , especi if you realiz that thi exchang is meant to be taken serious . 
mr . gregg `` i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisi `` araki , the writer and director of thi film , want to show how import teenag are , and want to show how they feel in such a horribl , horribl world . 
and how doe he show it ? 
by realli cheap surreal , and moron exchang like thi . 
oh , and it get better . 
a similar bit of dialogu is said in the middl of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in thi film ( i 'm not count the sever masturb scene ) . 
in it , one of the protagonist is hump away on top of anoth , and he say to her someth along the line of `` do you ever wonder what life is all about ? `` 
sorri , man : foreplay take place befor the act of coitu . 
of cours , what do you expect : the film wa written and direct by a guy who ca n't even spell hi first name right ( ye , i know it 's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) . 
`` the doom gener `` is advertis as a road trip movi about peopl who go around kill other who attack them , and also as anoth `` teen angst `` film ( one of the slogan is `` teen is a four-lett word `` - hardi har har ) . 
it 's a film about two angsti teen - ami blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in `` scream `` ) and jordon white ( jame duval , who would go on to play randi quaid 's son in `` independ day `` ) - who pick up an angsti homicid maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsti lead guitarist in `` that thing you do ! `` 
- and by the way , do you get the symbol ? 
red , white , and blue ? 
huh ? 
huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three thing happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird peopl ; 3 ) they kill them . 
the film is basic a remix of a bunch of other far superior film . 
gregg araki obvious ha seen such film as `` easi rider , `` `` natur born killer , `` and `` kalifornia , `` and tri to borrow element from all these film and make someth which is like a pop cultur refer guid . 
but what he forget is these film either repres someth that thi film doe not , or that they dug deep into their subject and brought someth out of them to make them deeper . 
`` the doom gener `` doe n't want to do thi ; it just want to show everyth in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki doe not want to deal with them on ani kind of real level . 
he want to show everyth in a weird manner , and forget what the scene are suppos to be about . 
here 's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : ami and jordan go into a quick- mart type place to get food and other stuff . 
ami is smoke , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist thi film is , i realli do ) , tell her to put it out . 
she tell him to fuck off or someth to that note . 
he point a shotgun at her , and she put it out reluctantli . 
jordan make two hot dog , and take them to the counter . 
the cash regist ring up `` 6 . 66 `` 
( oh , and thi symbol doe n't stop here ) . 
jordan check for hi wallet but it 's realli in the car . 
he ask ami for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well . 
the clerk bring out hi shotgun again and ask for the money . 
they say they do n't have it . 
he get readi to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditch in the middl of nowher a scene befor , pop out of nowher , fight with the clerk , and end with him blow the clerk 's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) . 
the head is shown fli through the air , and land in a fryer , where it begin to scream . 
i do n't realli object to thi kind of sick violenc , but thi scene is in the film for one reason and one reason onli : to gross you out . 
araki think that if he take everyth to the extrem , he 'll make some kind of art . 
wrong . 
it take a kind of resist to make gore art . 
when georg romero made `` dawn of the dead , `` a veri gori flick even for today , he had control over everyth and still wa abl to make everyth sick . 
same goe for peter jackson 's disgustingli gori `` dead aliv , `` which featur a 30 minut long fest of blood , gut , dismember , flesh chew , and other assort stuff , all end with a guy with a lawn mower strap to hi bodi , take out all sort of zombi . 
it wa sick , but it wa also satir , and control . 
a scene like thi ha no purpos in the film , and it stick out from everyth els that happen . 
here 's a coupl other scene : jordan and ami have sex in a bath tub and xavier watch , masturb , and then lick the semen from hi hand ; xavier and ami have sex and jordan watch from the window , masturb , and fall backward ; a man attack the trio , and is stab in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so thi could happen ) ; a fast food employe stalk the trio , and hi arm is shot off by xavier ; and variou other annoy . 
also , look for about a million camo from a wide assort of peopl , who probabl did n't realli know what they were get into when they sign up to do it ( just like peter o'tool , helen mirren , malcolm macdowel , and john gielgud probabl did n't when they sign to be in `` caligula `` ) . 
peopl such as indi actor parker posey and nicki katt , altern rock star skinni puppi and perri farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christoph `` peter bradi `` mcknight , amanda bears , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of second , then disappear so that we can return to the annoy main plot line . 
whi are they here ? 
so that we can all point to them and say `` hey , look it 's ( fill in the blank ) ! 
wow ! `` 
gim me a break . 
the film 's mean is pretti easi to detect : that , you know , teen are so preciou , and the world is such a horribl place , that when the two entiti collid , there 's a giant explos of horrif violenc . 
otherwis defin as `` teen angst , `` or the belief that be a teenag is a horribl thing and that the world is too bad for you . 
look , i 'm 19 year old . 
i went through a veri brief teen angst thing which curious last about as long as my tast in nirvana did . 
i 've sinc move on to `` i do n't realli know what to do with my life `` phase , but the teen angst phase is someth which is so annoyingli sophomor and ignor that ani film that think they 're deal with it on ani kind of seriou level is just beat the wrong hors . 
part of be a teen is experi , and test the water . 
it 's not whine about how aw parent are , and purpos feel dispond . 
thi is what the charact in thi film do , and the film want to show how they 're these great peopl who are be punish by the world becaus they 're teenag , and how they tri to defend themselv but ca n't total overcom them . 
it 's not their fault they kill peopl ; it 's the world 's ! 
what they realli need is a realiti check . 
the world is a bad place , and teenag can be easili harm becaus they are experi . 
but part of it is take everyth that happen to you and learn from it . 
the film think that teenag are basic doom , and there 's noth they can do about it . 
henc the titl . 
not onli doe it have bad fallaci , but it ca n't even express thi in an intellig and coher manner . 
everyth 's overli surreal , and all we get are scene of graphic violenc and graphic sex . 
how doe xavier lick semen off hi hand express teen angst ? 
how doe a talk decapit head show that teen are dispond becaus the world make them thi way ? 
and whi doe the film constantli go back to the teen angst issu of the film ? 
if araki had ani kind of compet in write or direct , he 'd show them for what they realli are . 
and if he did n't want the satir approach , he 'd show the real problem with the world . 
and if you still do n't think that `` the doom gener `` is incompet on everi singl possibl level it could be , take the act . 
rose macgowan is horribl . 
ye , she prove herself talent in `` scream , `` but she 's so bad in `` the doom gener `` that if i had not seen her in `` scream , `` i would have christen her one of the worst actress work in film today . 
her entir perform is one-not ( bitchi ) , and the one scene where she cri over a dead anim is so forc that it 's laughabl . 
equal bad is jonathan schaech , who want to be the slacker serial killer : someon who doe n't have ani remors becaus emot caus some kind of strain . 
hi perform is annoy as hell , and grant , he wa better in `` that thing you do ! `` 
and then there 's jame duval . 
let 's just say he make keanu reev look like brando . 
he ha the same kind of slacker stutter , onli much much much wors , and everi line he say is so bad that i have now deem him `` least talent actor in the world . `` 
i have seen lot of bad actor , but jame duval ha got to be the worst . 
or at least somewher up there . 
here 's anoth exampl of a bad scene , if you 're still not convinc : the film open up in a club where they 're play nine inch nail 's most banal song , `` heresi `` ( exampl of the line : `` god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i 'll see you there `` ) , and as the song play , and red strobe light show the patron danc , the film pan over to ami , just stand there , look dispond . 
the film close in on her , she look right at the camera and say `` fuck . `` 
no explan of thi should be necessari . 
and final , a note to gregg : grow up . 
realli . 
move out of your parent 's basement , read someth other than saling , and get a day job . 
and do n't quit it .
