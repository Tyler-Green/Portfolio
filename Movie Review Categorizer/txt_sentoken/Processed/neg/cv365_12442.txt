welcom to your oh-so typic sequel . 
it tri to be twice as big as it 's predecessor , yet end up twice as shallow . 
shallow . . . . hmm . . . now there 's an idea . 
mayb if the ill-fat cruis liner in thi movi had struck a shallow reef earli on thing may have turn out better . 
the first thing that struck me . . . and 
surpris me , wa that the camera work ( for the open sequenc anyway ) wa terribl . 
look like the cameramen were drunk and kept trip on their own feet . . . . . . veri 
differ to the origin movi . 
the charact ? 
well , not mani of the charact actual * had * charact , but here 's a rundown . 
anni , who wa the highlight of the the origin , must have serious bang her head in the train crash at the end of the first movi . 
whi ? 
becaus someth 's got to account for her lose that mani iq point . 
even though anni wa n't exactli a rocket scientist in speed , here some of her action just make you want to beat your head against a wall . 
for instanc , after success use a chainsaw to cut a hole in a door so that a group of peopl can escap noxiou gase - she stand in the middl of the open for about five minut till someon remind her that the peopl ca n't get ut till she get 's the chainsaw out of their face . . . . bang 
bang bang 
in point of fact sandra 's charact is turn into littl more than one of those scantli dress extra from hercul , who constantli ha to be rescu . 
jason patric ? 
all i can say is bring back keanu . 
keanu reev might have the emot rang of a tree stump . . . but 
that 's one more tree stump than jason ha . 
i do n't think he chang facial express all movi - jason , smile for the camera ! ! 
now frown ! . . . i said frown . . . . oh . . . you are . . . bang 
bang bang . . 
wooden just doe n't describ thi guy perform , but it 'll have to do . 
the bad guy . . . . . ahh . . . william 
dafo - there 's a bright move . 
how can you go wrong with the star from that acknowledg classic , bodi of evid ? 
( ye , that is sarcasm ) . 
hi wide eye maniac of a charact doe n't start out too bad . . . . but 
goe steadili downhil as the movi progress . 
in the end he degener to chase anni around for a hostag , even though he alreadi ha the money and can escap . . . . bang 
bang . 
though i 'd like to give thi movi a doubl thumb down , there were some nice sequenc . 
consid the movi cost over 100 million dollar - you 'd hope there 'd be at least a coupl . 
the real eye-popp for me , even though it wa given away in the trailer . . . . bang 
bang . . . . . wa the sequenc where the cruis liner sideswip the oil tanker . 
thi look terrif and i wa veri surpris to hear that the cruis liner in it wa . . . . complet 
comput gener ! 
wow . . . . i 
do n't think i 've ever seen a cg model look so real befor . 
the sequenc where jason patric in tri to disabl the propel from under the ship is also terrif , and the onli time dure the entir movi where you get that feel of . . . . speed . 
thi lack-of-spe problem affect mani sequenc . 
such as the oil tanker part . . . . . it wa - `` oh no , we 're go to hit the oil tanker ! `` , 
20 minut later - `` oh no , we 're go to hit the oil tanker ! `` 
20 min . . . . you 
get the point . 
thi movi fail simpli becaus it did n't live up to it 's name . . . . there 
wa veri littl feel of speed . 
in the origin movi , the lead charact had to make split second decis to surviv . . . . . in thi movi it felt more like - `` well peopl , we 're gon na run into that there island in a few hour - i think i might stroll over to engin and see if i ca n't turn off the engin . . . i 'm 
pass the cafeteria on the way , can i get anybodi anyth ? `` 
the end of thi movi realli is terribl . 
even though it featur what i 've sinc found out is one of the most expens sequenc ever in a movi - it just doe n't work at all . 
the part where the liner crash through the town look veri realist , but . . . . surpris 
surpris - it just take waaaaay too long . 
it seem to go for 15 minut befor the ship final stop . 
one thing that struck me as extrem poor scripti wa that as the ship crash through the harbour and town , around 25 peopl are kill by the ship . . . . and 
there 's onli 15 or so peopl left on the ship . 
so when it stop safe and sound and the charact are all cheer - the audienc is sit back and think - `` wait a sec . . . thi is a happi moment becaus ? `` 
bang bang 
then there wa the dog . . . . . i 
almost fell out of my seat when i saw the bit with the dog dodg the fall debri . 
put a dog in peril ha becom the ultim hollywood clich . . . . . . everi 
movi seem to have a 'dog-in-dang ' sequenc - volcano , dant 's peak , independ day , daylight , twister . 
lost world . . . . . . etc , 
etc . 
thi movi is a perfect exampl of how not to make a sequel . 
director jan de bont should tri watch the orign movi and thi one back-to-back and see if he realis where he went wrong .
