capsul : an insult . 
a stupid and incompet movi that doe n't even have the benefit of be trashili enjoy . 
wesl and woodi would do well to leav thi off their resum . 
money train is one of the worst movi i have ever seen . 
it 's not simpli idiot , it 's contemptu of it audienc . 
it tri to make us swallow thing that a better movi would be stop cold by or just plain omit entir . 
it 's a wast of wesley snipe and woodi harrelson , who are enjoy actor in their own right but are nauseat here . 
it 's not even fun as trash . 
woodi and wesley star ( mayb that 's not the right word ) as new york citi transit author polic . 
they have a job which could actual be the core of a realli interest movi : one of them play drunk possum to attract chain-snatch and the other doe lookout . 
i had a whole head of legal and ethic question surround thi , rais by a documentari i 'd seen on the subject onc , but the movi doe not wast ani time with be intellig or thought-provok . 
see if you can follow thi . 
they chase a kid down the tunnel and into the station where the `` money train `` , the heavili armor car that pick up all the cash from the token book , is park . 
the guard on the train see thi kid run at them , lift their machin gun , shout `` halt ! `` 
and then open fire when the kid doe n't stop run at them . 
blam , the kid 's dead . 
then woodi and wesley show up , and of cours the other ta cop hate them ( whi ? ) , and a push match start , and someon get deck , and . . . i cover my face . 
i 'd seen enough . 
i 've never seen a movi work so hard and in so littl time to destroy , systemat , ani chanc of be credibl or interest . 
fed up with the bs at their job ( most of it their own goddamn fault ) , woodi and wesley hatch thi plot about how to rob the money train . 
henc the titl , in case some of you ( all two of you ) did n't figur it out yet . 
then there 's thi subplot about a maniac who torch token book clerk , * and * a love stori , * and * a holdup -- no , two holdup , sorri , easi to lose track in a movi thi braindead -- * and * a mob boss who want hi money . 
there wa n't a minut when i gave a hors 's ass about ani of it . 
neither woodi nor wesley play charact that are interest for a singl minut . 
we do not care about them . 
they are not interest . 
they are noisi , loud , stupid , foolish jerk who whould have flunk out of the polic academi . 
they deserv to get shot -- or run over , as the case may be . 
they onli exist to rehash the kind of dynam that wa * written * into a movi like white men ca n't jump , and which simpli doe not exist here . 
they are idiot , and we 're expect to root for them . 
bullcrap . 
the movi is complet schizophren in it tone and textur . 
what exactli is thi mess ? 
a cop movi ? 
polic procedur is not given a moment 's genuin thought anywher . 
a thriller ? 
the subplot with the token booth killer is inept , a throwaway that should have been ditch in the rewrit . 
a comedi ? 
the few joke that do work are wast . 
a drama ? 
all dramat tension between both princip is freeze-dri and off-the-rack . 
there 's not a moment in the movi where i felt like i wa listen to genuin human be talk ; it 's all screenwriteres , that bizarr analect where everi sentenc end in a punchlin and the primari mode of express is the uniqu conjunct of four-lett word . 
( actual dialogu excerpt : `` fuck you . `` 
`` what ? `` 
`` you heard me : fuck * you * . `` 
`` no : fuck * you * ! `` ) 
look . i 'll be honest here . 
i 've tri write screenplay , and even * i * suspect that if i tri to pitch thi mess , i 'd get laugh out of the offic . 
anyon interest in hear my idea for a few good movi can write me and hear my pitch , becaus god know i know i can do better . 
i 've weast enough time on thi piec of tripe .
