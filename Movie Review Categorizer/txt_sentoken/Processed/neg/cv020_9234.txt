`` spawn `` featur good guy , bad guy , lot of fight , bloodi violenc , a leather-clad machin gun chick , gooey , self-heal bullet hole , scatolog humor and a man-eat monster . 
it not onli appear to have been tailor made for a swarm of 12- and 13-year-old boy , it appear to have been made by them . 
in a classic exampl of tell and not show , `` spawn `` open with a truckload of mumbo jumbo about forc of dark , forc of light and how `` men are the one who creat evil on earth . `` 
so much for a messag . 
the movi then lurch forward into the plight of al simmon ( michael jai white ) , a govern assassin/op who is murder by diabol boss jason wynn ( martin sheen , who play all of hi scene like an oscar clip ) while on a top secret mission in a north korean biolog weapon plant . 
simmon goe to hell and back , after make a deal with satan himself -- if he agre to command the devil 's armi to overtak the world , he 'll be allow to return to earth to see hi wife wanda ( underus theresa randl ) and littl girl cyan ( sydni beaudoin ) . 
of cours , see as how five year ha pass , wanda ha fallen for -- and marri -- simmon ' partner ( d . b . 
sweeney ) . 
hi , uh , shoulder to cri on come in the form of clown ( john leguizamo ) , a disgustingli disproport minion of satan 's . 
clown manipul simmon , now in superhuman spawn form , into a stand off with wynn . 
wynn , who think he is in leagu with the double-d clown , recogn spawn as a threat and undergo an oper where a bomb is place on hi heart -- when it stop beat , major citi around the world will deton , caus the leak of a diseas that `` make the ebola viru look like a skin rash . `` 
phew . got all that ? 
it would be easi to dismiss `` spawn `` as just anoth one of those heavy-on-fx , short-on-subst action pic , but it doe n't even work on that level . 
the computer-gener sequenc are often and plenti , and the problem is that they look too computer-gener . 
the sever scene set in hell present a devil that look and act like a video game graphic -- with the movi 's healthi budget you 'd think they could have afford to make hi mouth move when he talk . 
other element of the movi are so-so ; spawn 's enorm red , flow cape is a wonder sight , but it 's too obviou when he 's be play by a costum actor or an imag . 
in movi like `` contact , `` the special effect serv the stori . 
in `` spawn , `` they are the stori . 
and spawn himself is n't even an interest charact . 
the film 's relianc on razzle-dazzl would be accept if we were given somebodi to root for , but both simmon and hi funki alter-ego are complet underdevelop . 
what we need is a batman , a luke skywalk . 
even watch the adventur of kleenex man would be more interest than spawn . 
poor leguizamo . 
he star in februari 's `` the pest , `` a movi that i still think is the year 's worst so far , although thi one doe give it a run for it money . 
as clown , he overact to the extrem , never miss an opportun for a poor-tast punchlin . 
leguizamo fart green mist , munch a pizza slice cover with maggot and even don a mini-skirt and perform a cheerlead routin , all befor turn into a giant grey demon . 
the guy wa brilliant in `` to wong foo , thank for everyth ! 
juli newmar . `` 
what is he do wast hi talent in thi and `` the pest `` ? 
i 'm one of the few peopl that like `` batman & robin , `` thi summer 's other big-budget comic book film . 
yet after catch thi movi and make the inevit comparison , i can onli hope peopl will chang their mind and think of `` batman `` as the superior adapt . 
there 's a compel stori somewher in `` spawn `` -- includ strong religi overton and the debut of the first african-american superhero ever -- but it 's just not found anywher near here . 
as it is , `` spawn `` is just aw -- it stink wors than a dead trout .
