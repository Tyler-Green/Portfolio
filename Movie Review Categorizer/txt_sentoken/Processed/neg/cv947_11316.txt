what were they think ? 
nostalgia for the seventi is bad enough , but do we realli need an eighti film ? 
robbi hart ( adam sandler ) use to want to be a rock and roll star , but in 1985 he 's sing at wed and have a good time . 
a romant at heart , he love wed and is just about to get marri to hi high-school sweeti . 
when she leav him wait at the altar , hi tune chang to `` love stink `` . 
he meet waitress julia ( drew barrymor ) who is engag to a junk-bond salesman and you know that they are go to get togeth . 
in fact you know everyth that is go to happen dure thi movi . 
sandler is somewhat adequ in hi lead man role , but there is no spark . 
barrymor doe n't seem to be abl to convey anyth other than a pretti face with noth behind it : beauti but no attitud . 
both charact are just there . 
bit part by steve buscemi and jon lovitz steal the show . 
the eighti are shove in our face . 
refer to delorean , madonna , `` dalla `` , ivana and donald , burt and loni and `` miami vice `` get old fast . 
the filmmak must have realiz that there wa n't much entertain to the stori and thought they could dazzl the audienc with humor period allus . 
they 're not funni and it doe n't work . 
with chang on all front acceler more and more , nostalgia appear to have a great appeal , but do n't you think we could have more than 14 year befor we yearn for the past . 
mayb we can look forward to a film next year wax nostalg about el nino . 
( michael redman ha written thi column for over 23 year and he know that nostalgia is not what it use to be . )
