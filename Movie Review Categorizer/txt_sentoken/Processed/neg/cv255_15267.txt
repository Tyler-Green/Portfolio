movi do n't come much more ridicul titl than `` i still know what you did last summer , `` but sinc the movi in question is best describ as ridicul , the titl sort of work as a warn . 
more than a silly-sound mouth to blurt out to the ticket vendor , thi horror sequel 's monik also contain a grievou oversight that anyon who saw the origin will be abl to spot : what `` you `` did _last_ summer `` you `` actual did the summer _before_ last summer , and sinc `` i `` knew about it _this_ summer as well as _last_ summer , it 's realli illog to say that `` i `` _still_ know what `` you `` did _last_ summer . 
the filmmak would have at least made sens with the shorter `` i still know , `` the longer `` i still know what you did two summer ago `` or the appropri `` stupid peopl get hack to bit . `` 
that last suggest is the prefer one sinc the charact in thi film do thing that are the polar opposit of smart . 
for exampl , if your roommat is plagu by terribl nightmar as a result of be stalk and nearli murder not long ago , would you sneak into her room late at night and hide in the closet , even if it wa just to locat and borrow a cute littl dress ? 
probabl not , but that 's precis what colleg student karla ( pop diva brandi ) doe to best friend juli ( jennif love hewitt ) , result in the first in a long line of phoni fright . 
juli , you 'll recal , wa one of the sole survivor at the end of 1997 's surpris hit `` i know what you did last summer , `` after a slasher with a grudg to bear - it 's a _long_ stori - began tri to pick off her , her buddi and variou other in their coastal carolina villag . 
in thi instal , the plot pick up as karla win a trip to the bahama , and juli , yet rack by guilt , decid that mayb a tropic getaway will help eas her mind . 
yeah , right . 
their island paradis ha room , of cours , for one more in the form of the still-al killer ( muse watson ) from the first film . 
he sport the same gorton 's fisherman get-up , a heavi hat and rain slicker that mask hi ident , but whi he 's still tri to stay anonym is a mysteri thi movi never solv . . . 
though i suppos hi hook-hand would look funni protrud from the sleev of a leisur suit . 
in a sens , that 's the movi 's glare flaw - everybodi know who the bad guy is , thu evapor the level of paranoid tension nice sustain by it prequel . 
the murder and attempt murder in that film were vivid and scari , but trey callaway 's deriv `` i still know `` screenplay make the fisherman just as dumb as hi pretti potenti victim . 
when juli lay bliss unawar in a tan bed , give him a perfect chanc to wreak vengeanc onc and for all , what doe he do ? 
he twist-ti the lid shut and crank up the uv ray - you 'd think he 'd want her gut now instead of a skin cancer victim later . 
even prequel `` summer `` lover might balk at how littl there is here beyond sporad amus absurd and a few neat-o shot of blood flow from tone teenag flesh . 
the innov gallow humor that scribe ( and `` scream `` wunderkind ) kevin williamson inject into `` i know `` 's unfold stori is sore miss , replac with the grate antic of a white rastafarian cabana boy who smoke weed and toss off slang like `` yo `` ; you 'll cheer - not shriek - when he end up with a pair of hedgetrimm firmli implant in hi chest . 
if `` i know what you did last summer , `` howev effect , wa just the kind of movi that those subvers `` scream `` flick poke fun at , then the deadli `` i still know what you did last summer `` deserv a full-blown roast on `` mysteri scienc theatr 3000 . ``
