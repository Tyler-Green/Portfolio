two parti guy bob their head to haddaway 's danc hit `` what is love ? `` 
while get themselv into troubl in nightclub after nightclub . 
it 's bare enough to sustain a three-minut _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ produc lorn michael , _clueless_ creator ami heckerl , and paramount pictur saw someth in the late night televis institut 's recur `` roxburi guy `` sketch that would presum make a good featur . 
emphasi on the word `` presum . `` 
_a_night_at_the_roxbury_ take an already-thin concept and tedious stretch it far beyond the break point -- and that of viewer ' patienc level . 
the first five minut or so of _roxbury_ play veri much like one of the origin `` roxburi guy `` skit . 
with `` what is love ? `` 
blare on the soundtrack , the brotherli duo of doug and steve butabi ( chri kattan and will ferrel ) bob their head , scope out `` hotti `` at club , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrust . 
there is one crucial differ , howev -- these guy speak . 
that littl fact ha been use as justif for the film 's exist , that the butabi ' newfound capac for speech would open up a whole new set of door for the charact . 
the door open by director john fortenberri and screenwrit steve koren , ferrel , and kattan are new , that 's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead end . 
there is no stori per se , onli a loos structur and link seri of subplot . 
the brother liter run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entranc into the exclus roxburi club . 
there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicu uncredit -- can you blame him ? ) , who take an interest in an idea of their . 
meanwhil , the bro ' overbear father ( dan hedaya ) want them to stop club . 
when doug refus and the dimwit steve obey hi father , a rift is creat between the two . 
the narr messi of _roxbury_ would have been forgiv if all that went on were the slightest bit funni , but virtual none of it is . 
the assembl press audienc mostli sat stonili silent throughout the entir film , with the one big except be a big laugh near the end . 
ala , the joke -- a rather lazi takeoff on _jerry_maguire_ -- will onli strike a chord with peopl who have seen that film . 
grant , a lot of peopl _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film 's best joke is complet depend on one 's familiar with anoth film say a lot about _roxbury_ 's lack of inspir . 
that lack of inspir can be trace back to the insipid charact themselv . 
like too mani of the skit on the current incarn of _saturday_night_live_ , `` the roxburi guy `` is a one-jok sketch that never onc suggest that the charact have enough comic life in them to surviv outsid of the sketch context . 
after watch one of the `` roxburi `` skit on snl , thi is what you come away with from the charact : they bob their head to `` what is love ? `` , 
bump unsuspect women , and . . . that 's all . 
after watch _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you 'll be left with exactli the same .
