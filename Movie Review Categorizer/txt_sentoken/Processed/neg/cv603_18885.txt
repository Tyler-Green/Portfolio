i have never seen a man so in love with himself than georg luca . 
with the overt success of the three origin star war film , luca ha becom , not necessarili a filmmak , but the head cheez at a huge toy compani , with the phantom menac the new product on the shelv . 
onli thi toy wa made for $ 115 million , but everi kid want it , and , like all other expens toy , fall apart within an hour after play with it . 
the product in question , star war episod 1 : the phantom menac ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simpl : it about the money , babi ! 
no one in their right mind would creat such a fiasco if they knew it would n't make a ton of money befor it fourth week of releas . 
i come to the sw franchis as a stranger , sinc i have absolut no idea whi the sw movi are so popular . 
i find them rather bore and full of noth but eye candi . 
phantom menac is like the first sw , minu 10 . 
noth in the whole concept is remot enjoy . 
even the special effect seem rather bland . 
the stori in thi new one is a mindless mess . . . the 
act wooden . . . and the action sequenc like someth out of a video game . 
sw : phantom menac is one of the worst film of the year so far . 
with a titl like sw e1 : tpm , luca ha one big head on those shoulder . 
i thought chri carter did for releas an x-file movi , although , that movi adapt wa an excel way to spend two hour . 
pm is one long headach .
