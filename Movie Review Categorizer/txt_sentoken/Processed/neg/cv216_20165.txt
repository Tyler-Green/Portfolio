as far as `` mysteri men `` is concern , the burn question is less `` is it realli as bad as it look from the trailer ? `` 
( the answer there is an unequivoc `` ye `` ) and more `` how in the name of sweet jesu did first-tim director kinka usher get such a first-rat cast to act in thi muck ? `` 
`` mysteri men `` featur greg kinnear as the heavily-sponsor captain amaz and geoffrey rush as hi arch nemesi ( singular ) casanova frankenstein . 
a verit polic lineup of hot hollywood talent play the superhero wannab of the titl , who join forc to get c . amaz out of a tight spot when c . frankenstein put the screw on champion citi . 
there 's william h . maci as the mild-mann shovel , hank azaria as the cutlery-fling blue raja ( no knive , but a phoni english accent that 's just as sharp ) , ben stiller as mr . furiou ( whose onli power seem to be hi abil to get hot under the collar ) , janean garofalo as a craze bowler with her father 's skull interestingli preserv , we studi as a rhetoric-spout cowl aveng , and kel mitchel as the token ( and , ad insult to injuri , invis ! ) 
black guy . 
bring up the rear , so to speak , is paul reuben ( ye , that 's pee wee herman paul reuben ) as . . . 
well , let 's just call him the ga man . 
the product design is overblown , the special effect are overdon , and the script ( base on bob burden 's `` dark hors `` comic book seri ) is overbak . 
the appeal actor are uniformli good and stiller is even stellar , but they ca n't begin to save `` mysteri men `` -- it 's just one big mess . 
you 're better off rent the video and press fast-forward to get to the funni bit . 
i believ i count three .
