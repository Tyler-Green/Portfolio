well , here 's a distast , thoroughli amateurish item that , surprisingli , wa actual a box-offic hit at the time of it releas . 
after just view the film for the first time , my primari question is how did anyon with an iq north of 35 enjoy thi movi ? 
it is cheap , idiot , unfunni , and not nearli as raunchi as i had heard it wa . 
at least some smut would have liven thing up a bit . 
`` porki 's , `` tell the stori ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddi , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billi ( mark herrier ) , tommi ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desper want to get laid . 
women , for the most part , are a mysteri to them ( and in thi movi , they are to the audienc , as well , sinc all of them are written and act as if they are alien from a differ planet ) . 
their plan is sidetrack , howev , when they ventur out to a smarmi strip bar name porki 's , which they are abl to get into use fake id 's . 
after they pay the manag one-hundr buck for three hooker , they are play a trick on and find themselv be dump into the swamp below the build . 
for these four teenag guy , thi mean war on porki 's . 
`` porki 's , `` ultim manag to fail on almost everi possibl level . 
as a teenag sex-romp , it is not wild or amus enough . 
as a comedi , all of the joke are predict and fall flat . 
as a look back at the 1950 's , it is someth , i suspect , most peopl from that era would want to buri deep in a grave . 
and as a reveng movi , it is a crush bore . 
one of the most offens thing about , `` porki 's , `` is how jaw-droppingli inaccur the film is about teenag . 
the four main charact are not even attempt to be develop as charact , and we learn veri littl about them , except that they are horni and would probabl feel more comfort in a preschool . 
that sure is reveal inform . 
the femal charact fare even wors under the inaudaci screenplay and direct by bob clark . 
the women are all treat as object or comedi prop , rather than real peopl . 
for exampl , the two gym teacher , mr . balbrick ( nanci parson ) and honeywel ( kim cattral ) , onli have one purpos , and that is to be made fun of . 
mr . balbrick is a gruff , no-holds-bar , overwight woman who will not stand for ani foolish , and , in one particularli embarrass scene for all involv , honeywel ha sex with a coach and bark like a dog . 
there is no way to tell if parson or cattral are servic actress ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are ask to do thing in thi film that are not at all funni , onli humili . 
to prove how out-of-touch thi so-cal comedi is , compar it to other more seriou 80 's film about teenag , and it look even wors in comaprison . 
ani of the john hugh pictur , such as 1984 's `` sixteen candl , `` or , 1985 's `` the breakfast club , `` put , `` porki 's , `` at an even greater shame . 
those film actual dealt with seriou teen matter , but remain a great deal funnier , thank to their bright and truth write . 
and heck , if , `` porki 's , `` want to be a teenag sex movi , i 'd take 1982 's `` fast time at ridgemont high , `` or 1982 's `` the last american virgin , `` over thi ani day of the week . 
director bob clark is not a bad director . 
two year after he made , `` porki 's , `` he direct the nostalg holiday classic , `` a christma stori . `` 
i would forgiv him for thi misfir , in fact , if it wa n't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay . 
just the thought that someon would actual sit down to write such a piec of garbag , and think that it wa actual a film worth releas unto the unsuspect world , is actual a whole lot funnier than anyth in , `` porki 's . ``
