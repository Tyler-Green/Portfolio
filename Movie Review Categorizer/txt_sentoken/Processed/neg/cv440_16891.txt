the comet-disast flick is a disast alright . 
direct by toni scott ( top gun ) , it tell the stori about an asteroid the size of texa caught on a collis cours with earth . 
and you thought that dinki littl comet in deep impact wa troubl . 
jeez . 
after a great open , in which an american spaceship , plu the citi of new york , are complet destroy by a comet shower , nasa detect the said asteroid and go into a frenzi . 
they hire the world 's best oil driller ( bruce willi ) , and send him and hi crew up into space to fix our globel problem . 
that 's like send a mous into a cat carrier , is n't it ? 
the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicr for word , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a coupl of time . 
i wa not alon . 
plu , to see a wonder actor like billi bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a wast of the actor 's talent . 
the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzi fx shot . 
the onli real reason for make thi film wa to somehow out-perform deep impact . 
produc jerri bruckheim fail with armageddon .
