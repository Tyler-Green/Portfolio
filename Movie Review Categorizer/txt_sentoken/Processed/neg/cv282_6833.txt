the premis of turbul is i 'm sure veri familiar to us all . 
we 've seen it befor in passeng 57 , execut decis , and countless other flick that are good in there own way . 
you know , terrorist take over a plane , ask the polic on the ground for what they what and so on . 
turbul start out with a `` convict `` ray liotta be accus of a crime . 
you think there is no way he could have done it , he 's so open and kind . 
he is taken in and is subsequ transport on a commer plane to la . 
thi is alreadi a problem . 
there is no way that convict would be transport on the same commerci flight that normal passang would be on . 
anyway , it is christma eve and everyon is wait to get to la and spend christma eve there . 
well , convict one manag to stop the flight in it proverbi `` track `` and liotta , still as calm as ever , take the other convict out . 
he also ha eye for lauren holli , a flight attend , and seem to grow closer to her . 
`` the plot stop here `` 
i did n't like thi movi becaus it seem to be a rip off of everi other airplan movi i 've ever seen . 
at one point , mr . liotta look exactli like jack nicholson in the shine ( i 'm seriou ! ) . 
it wa like they stole for everi other movi down to a `` t `` . 
the onli reason i did not give thi 0 star is becaus it had some okay stunt . 
do n't even bother !
