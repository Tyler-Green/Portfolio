1989 's `` major leagu `` wa a delight surpris . 
i did n't expect much of it when i decid to watch it on cabl , but it prove to be fresh and funni . 
howev , when the appeal of a movi is it fresh , the sequel are virtual guarante to be stale . 
that 's certainli true of `` major leagu ii `` and the most recent entri , `` major leagu : back to the minor . `` 
the titl is , of cours , a contradict . 
should n't it be `` minor leagu ? `` 
that contradict suggest the length to which writer/director john warren ha gone to squeez a third movi out of the formula establish by the first movi . 
origin star charli sheen and tom bereng ( who return for `` major leagu ii `` ) are not around , leav corbin bernsen the onli origin headlin to make the third movi . 
the other veteran who return ( denni haysbert as voodoo-inspir batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who wa introduc in `` leagu ii `` ) seem to be around just to lend legitimaci to the enterpris . 
the onli return cast member who produc ani laugh is bob uecker as radio announc harri doyl , inexplic broadcast the game of a minor leagu team far from hi home turf . 
the protagonist thi time around is retir pitcher gu cantrel ( scott bakula ) , who is hire by minnesota twin owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manag the twin ' aaa team , the buzz . 
you can write the movi from here : he find a group of misfit who need to learn how to play togeth as a team in order to win . 
there 's a futur superstar whose ego keep him from grow ( walton goggin ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barri ) , twin outfield both name juan ( the difilippo triplet ) , and a coupl pitcher with throw problem ( judson mill and peter mackenzi ) . 
along the way , gu pick up cerrano and tanaka ( gu is supposedli an old teammat of their , even though he wa n't in either of the preced film ) . 
sum total : none . 
the entir enterpris is artifici , and the cast is not readi for the hollywood major . 
gu ' antagonist is twin manag leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) . 
leonard is a slimi , snivel littl egotist , and the twin are lazi , spoil , and full of themselv . 
( even watch the first movi i wonder whi ani real-lif team would lend itself to be caricatur in thi manner ) . 
gu challeng leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twin . 
( wan na guess who win ? ) 
`` back to the minor `` is a movi that ha no reason to exist . 
there 's hardli a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movi left no room for even one sequel .
