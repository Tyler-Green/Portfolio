if you have ever seen fox tv 's special car chase program , you 'll have a good idea about the content of ronin , the new action `` thriller `` from director john frankenheim . 
the film involv a mysteri briefcas , that sever group of terrorist want to get their hand on . 
an irish women , dierdr ( play by the truman show 's natascha mcelhon ) , hire a group of mercenari to assist her in get the briefcas . 
among the peopl she hire are sam ( robert de niro ) , vincent ( jean reno ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsg ? rd from good will hunt ) . 
dierdr 's group assign is too seiz the briefcas while the current owner are transport it . 
they accomplish thi task , but a traitor is in the bunch and the briefcas is soon on the run again . 
the briefcas stay on the run , as the movi lead the viewer through sever plot twist that are badli execut . 
the writer seem to be attempt to make a smart action movi , but fail to understand that just becaus there are surpris , it doe n't add too the credibl of a senseless script . 
the plot twist get no reaction becaus they come at a time where no one care what is go on , after the appar climax of the film . 
but to add to the excit , as i mention earlier , there are endless car chase scene . 
they are unrealist and fail to add anyth to the stori . 
do n't get me wrong , i love car chase , but they were overdon and too long here . 
we never do find out what 's in the briefcas , but i doubt anyon care by the time they finish sit through thi two hour long attempt thriller .
