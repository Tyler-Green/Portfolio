i 've heard it call `` jaw with claw `` and that 's a fair summat of the plot , though that tag line doe littl to quantifi qualiti . 
director stephen hopkin ( blown away , predat 2 ) and screenwrit william goldman ( maverick , miseri ) would have you believ that thi is an epic histor drama about man against natur , base on what realli happen in africa to the railroad worker tri to build a bridg to the 20th centuri . 
they 've stack the deck with two big star ( val kilmer , michael dougla ) , a bigger product design , beauti photographi ( by academi award winner vilmo zsigmond ) , and a score so overblown that it make the lion king soundtrack sound like chamber music . 
the movi doe n't make a lick of sens , though , either as an epic or as your basic boo-fest . 
in fact , some of the bit are so laughabl ludicr that you may think you 've stumbl into the sequel to mysteri scienc theater 3000 : the movi . 
how about the three guy with rifl , who trap a lion and then ca n't even hit the damn thing ? 
or the ham-on-wri act of michael dougla , who chew more sceneri than the anim ever do ? ? 
or , my favorit , lion so agil that they can even climb onto rooftop ? ! ?
