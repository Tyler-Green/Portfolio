there are scene in `` the big hit `` that are so aw , they simpli defi descript . 
the movi is infect with the same kind of blunderhead idioci and misplac confid that made `` last action hero `` ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through . 
presum , `` the big hit `` is an action-comedi , a difficult but not imposs genr to pull off . 
movi of thi sort requir a fine balanc and care tone , and the comedi is usual meant to work as catharsi for the violenc . 
`` lethal weapon 2 `` ( 1989 ) is a perfect exampl of an action thriller that wa also veri , veri funni . 
unfortun , in `` the big hit , `` it seem that comedi is the main motiv , and the violenc is onli intend to punctuat the laugh . 
unfortun , there are no laugh . 
the movi resembl some of the goofi , throwaway ridicul of earli jacki chan film , but it doe n't benefit from chan 's incred stunt and goofi , charismat presenc . 
instead , we are left with a lot of digit effect and mark wahlberg , who must have consid himself invinc after hi critically-acclaim perform in last year 's `` boogi night . `` 
howev , if he want to maintain a decent career , he had better start select hi project more care - movi like thi are a sure-fir recip for a long career in the straight-to-video market . 
wahlberg play melvin smiley , an amiabl guy who also happen to be a profession hitman ( see `` gross point blank `` for the same charact , much better develop ) . 
the movi want us to think , `` gee how clever and iron - a guy who can kill without ani moral implic , and yet he ca n't stand for anyon not to like him . `` 
the fact is , melvin is so desper to keep peopl from not like him , that he put up with both an obnoxi fiance ( christina appleg , with a horrend new york accent ) and an abus girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is onli use him for hi money . 
hi constant bend over backward to pleas peopl make him a complet patsi at best , and a thoroughli unbeliev charact at worst . 
melvin is employ exclus by a crime boss name pari ( averi brook ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includ cisco ( lou diamond phillip ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbin ) . 
one day , melvin agre to do some moonlight with cisco by kidnap the teenag daughter of a rich japanes mogul name jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom . 
howev , not onli ha jiro nishi lost all hi money produc a big hollywood movi ( insid joke , get it ? ) , but hi kidnap daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happen to be pari ' goddaught . 
so , when pari find out she 's been kidnap , he take it person and becom determin to find out who did it . 
not know the cisco is actual behind the whole scheme , pari put him in charg of root out the kidnapp . 
of cours cisco blame the whole thing on poor , innoc melvin . 
along the way , there are sever obligatori gunfight , explos , and car chase , plu a liter cliffhang inspir by `` jurass park , `` and a complet unconvinc romanc between melvin and keiko ( who look like she 's bare push fifteen ) . 
what the movi pass off as humor resort to thoroughli unfunni joke about overweight jewish mother , hara-kiri , drink problem , leak bodi bag , and a run gag about how crunch ha recent discov the pleasur of masturb , and now spend all hi time do hand exercis . 
not to mention the pimpli video store clerk who is alway call melvin and screech about how he need to return hi copi of `` king kong live , `` which is two week overdu . 
thi mess of a movi wa helm by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director import by john woo ( `` face/off `` ) , who also serv as execut produc . 
woo need to stop act as a conduit for other director , and start make more of hi own film . 
wong , who direct such film as `` rock ' n'roll cop `` back in hong kong , is complet tone deaf when it come to comedi . 
mayb joke about vexati video clerk and vomit on other peopl are funni across the ocean , but they 're not here , at least in the manner wong handl them . 
mani of the problem can be trace back to the script , which wa pen by obviou freshman writer ben ramsey . 
in addit to hi vagu character and uninspir action sequenc , ramsey 's script assault the audienc with hi attempt to copi the vulgar , poetic rhythm of tarantino or mamet-styl dialogu . 
what he come out with is just a lot of annoy blather , most of which spew from the lip of lou diamond phillip ( whose favorit phrase is `` it 's all love `` ) and robin dunn , who play cisco 's stutter , black-wannab assist . 
the irrit factor of phillip and dunn combin is almost off the scale , which can pretti much describ the film as a whole .
