rene zellweg star as sonia , a young jewish wife and mother frustrat by the constraint of her hasid commun in brooklyn . 
her husband ( glenn fitzgerald ) is a religi scholar whose all-in-a-day's-work attitud on sex fail to tame the `` fire `` she feel within , as so she confess to the rebb ( after hear her fieri confess , the rebb suddenli get friski with hi pleasantli surpris wife -- and die the next morn ) . 
sens her frustrat , her husband 's brother ( christoph eccleston ) give her a job in hi jewelri broker busi in exchang for raw , passionless sex that just fan sonia 's still-burn flame . 
on the job , sonia befriend ramon ( allen payn ) , a cool blast of hunki puerto rican water who doe hi own jewelri design when not work as a grunt in an upscal jewelri store . 
can fire-tam be far be that far behind for the ever-smold sonia ? 
just about everyth in writer-director boaz yakin 's ring fals , start with the improb cast zellweg , who doe an adequ enough act job but simpli look too waspi for the role . 
a better fit would have been julianna marguli , who outshin zellweg as sonia 's take-no-crap sister-in-law . 
some of sonia 's babi step toward liber , such as indulg in a non-kosh egg roll in chinatown , come off as silli . 
yakin attempt to spice up the proceed with a touch of magic realism -- in the form of the recur presenc of sonia 's long-dead brother 's ghost -- make the stori feel even more trite than it alreadi is . 
`` i did n't know what to expect . 
it 's like someth you chase for so long , but then you do n't know how to react when you get it . 
i still do n't know how to react . ``
