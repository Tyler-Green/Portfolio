set in harlem dure the great depress , rival gangster `` famili `` go to war over control of `` the number `` , an illeg gambl lotteri . 
`` runner `` take bet from potenti lotteri winner and deliv them to privat locat for draw . 
the undisput leader of the harlem number is the madam queen ( cice tyson ) who is challeng by dutch schulz ( tim roth ) , a ruthless hoodlum . 
by turn against the queen , dutch defi hi partner , the infam lucki luciano ( andi garcia ) , who wish to respect the queen and keep the peac . 
the queen ' armi strengthen when an acquaint , ellsworth `` bumpi `` johnson ( lawrenc fishburn ) is releas from prison and becom a bodyguard for her . 
he prove himself worthi in short time as he thwart an assassin attempt ( on himself and the queen ) , and later take control of the queen armi when she is jail for tax evas . 
bumpi 's reign is not as restrain and subdu as the queen and he declar all out war on dutch . 
bloodi gang warfar ensu . 
bumpi face mani obstacl dure hi reign . 
hi new armi question hi method . 
hi girlfriend ( vanessa l . william ) and the queen disagre with hi violent solut . 
most importantli ( in hi eye ) , dutch ha becom a more formid foe than he imagin , and seek help from lucki luciano to assassin him . 
there have been so mani movi deal with organ crime that it must be hard to write an origin stori deal with it . 
thi movi is not origin at all . 
in fact , i wa anger by how mani similar there wa between thi film and , arguabl , the best gangster movi of all time , the godfath . 
if you are go to borrow idea from anoth movi and not give credit , whi not borrow from a lesser known movi ( say , miller cross ? ) . 
how could the credit screenwrit chri brancato not give credit to mario puzo himself ? 
here are just some of the major similar ( i stop count at 10 ) . 
crook cop assault blood rel of the leader . 
gang extract reveng on crook cop . 
wife ( or girlfriend ) question her partner ' murder activ and leav him . 
high rank `` offic `` betray the leader . 
blood rel of the leader murder . 
war erupt between the `` famili `` . 
high-rank offic disapprov of the leader in front of other famili member . 
new leader run famili differ from previou leader . 
larg meet with all famili involv . 
the setup in thi movi is done rather well . 
i enjoy the portray of the network of `` runner `` sprint through the street collect bet for the queen lotteri . 
thi wa the way of life in harlem , and most peopl involv with the queen did so becaus it wa the onli way to support their famili and put food on the tabl . 
number run wa the onli way for the harlem popul to find work . 
i also enjoy the interact between the angri , violent dutch and the calm , patient lucki . 
after about the 30-40 minut mark all of the similar with the godfath start appear , one after the other ( and in short order ) . 
it wa a huge distract , and an insult to my intellig . 
who wa the screenwrit kid here ? 
some of the individu perform were well done . 
andi garcia wa veri convinc as lucki , unfortun hi screen time is reduc to a support role . 
tim roth effect play the cocki villain , much like hi role in `` the cook , the thief , hi wife and her lover `` and `` rob roy `` . 
the good perform and convinc setup dure the first third of the movi do not make up for the lacklust stori that follow . 
a coupl of coincid is one thing , over a dozen is an insult .
