what are we go to do with jim carrey ? 
viewer of televis 's `` in live color `` know thi one-man cartoon from such charact as fire marshal bill . 
viewer also know that `` in live color `` is a skit-show and that a littl of jim carrey goe a long way . 
unfortun , thi fact wa forgotten by the maker of the carrey comedi ace ventura : pet detect . 
three writer , includ carrey , work on the slapstick stori , which send a self-styl `` pet detect `` on the trail of a stolen dolphin . 
the miss mammal belong to the miami dolphin , who need their mascot for the upcom superbowl . 
for plot porpois , thi stori work as well as ani three stoog short . 
carrey get to do hi `` offici `` schtick as he snoop around greater miami . 
he leer and sneer , crane hi neck to funni effect . 
he even doe hi captain kirk imperson . 
again . 
all of thi is pretti harmless stuff up until the point that you realiz that the writer have absolut no intent of focus on anyon * other * than carrey . 
( suggest altern titl -- jim carrey : will do anyth for a laugh . ) 
export it to franc and you may have a hit . 
as it stand , ace ventura is n't even good kid 's stuff . 
the profan count , alon , is too high . 
which is iron , sinc children are , probabl , carrey 's best audienc . 
the film doe n't even have the goofbal charm of chri elliott 's recent no-brain cabin boy . 
sure , carrey ha hi moment . 
but what can you say about a film whose high-point includ watch carrey slink around to the theme from `` mission imposs ? `` 
ace ventura ha one glare incongru . 
amid the butt-jok and double-tak , the script take great pain to set-up an elabor and rather funni `` cri game `` gag . 
and , for * thi * intend audienc , that take ( ahem ) cojon .
