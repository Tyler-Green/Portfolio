apparantli money talk . 
. 
. 
and use quit a bit of obscen do so ! 
i 've alway consid myself pretti open about the gratuiti a film can possess , whether in languag , violenc , sex , or what have you . 
i find that thi fact give me a littl more leverag to complain when a movi goe overboard , and money talk definit doe ! 
it 's not so much that the movi swore nearli constantli ( and i mean constantli ! ) , but it swore so much that it seem overli promin and way too stage . 
perhap if one charact were foul mouth , but in thi film , everybodi swear nearli everi other word . 
money talk is about a black ticket scalper name franklin hatchett ( play less annoyingli than expect by chri tucker ) . 
franklin is your typic con-man and end up with more than one person out to get him . 
when the plot final get underway , there 's no less than three peopl ( or group ) that want him , dead or aliv . 
the frenchman who 's somewhat respons for franklin 's escap from a prisoner-pack bu , a hoodlum whom franklin owe seven grand , and the cop who wrongli suspect him of murder . 
franklin 's onli hope : jame russel ( charli sheen ) , an investig report for the local news who 's out to prove himself a worthi journalist . 
jame offer to help clear franklin 's name if franklin will just allow him an exclus report to help channel 12 conquer sweep week . 
both of these element are complet lost along the way howev , and never do reappear . 
as expect , the odd coupl of franklin and jame do wind up friend at the end , which is anoth wast element see as how they show no sign of becom friend at ani point along the way . 
there is just noth origin or intrigu about thi film , and so mani develop are either non-relev , or just plain forgotten about . 
money talk is a paint-by-numb movi that lack ani real involv with the audienc . 
frivil dialogu , a predict , flat storylin , and two-dimension charact make money talk a reason to save your money .
