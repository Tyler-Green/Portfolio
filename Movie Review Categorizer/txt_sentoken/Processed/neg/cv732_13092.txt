i think that say that the x-file is one of thi summer 's most anticip film is safe . 
for five year , `` the x-file `` televis show ha develop a dedic fan cultur , whose rabid devot to the seri rival that of `` star trek `` fan . 
the premis of both the movi and the televis seri is two fbi agent who investig the paranorm ; fox mulder ( david duchovni ) is the avid believ whose quest to find the truth about extraterrestri life border on the paranoid , and dana sculli ( gillian anderson ) is the scientif skeptic tri to find a ration explan to mulder 's flight of fanci . 
outlin the plot of the x-file movi is virtual imposs , sinc to be gener would result in confus , yet to be specif would give too much away . 
nevertheless , i will tri . 
`` the black ooz , `` and extraterrestri , virus-lik substanc is threaten earth . 
a `` shadow govern `` is awar of thi , but tri to cover-up the alien exist . 
mulder and sculli know `` the truth is out there , `` and so tri to expos both the invas and the cover-up . 
there are three central question i have heard ask about thi movi : 1 . 
will those who do n't watch the seri be abl to understand the movi ? 
ye . 
isol as an individu text , the x-file can stand alon . 
they have given enough background for anyon , familiar with the show or not , to understand the movi . 
although some of the secondari charact ' histori may confus the uniniti , those charact are not essenti to the film . 
thi is a major problem : they trot out token secondari charact from the seri out for an appear and then disappear just as quickli . 
whi bring superintend skinner into the pictur in the first place , and then have him sat silent on an fbi intern affair committe ? 
whi bring in `` the lone gunmen , `` three comput geek conspiraci theorist , for an even briefer appear ? 
these charact are recurr on the seri , and their appear in the film wa met with whoop from the audienc ( suggest their popular among fan - actual most of the audienc could pass for `` the lone gunmen `` ) . 
still , then they vanish just as quickli . 
2 . the televis show never give us ani answer . 
will the movi actual explain some thing ? 
ye . 
in the x-file we get a fairli complet histori of `` the black ooz , `` what it is and what it want . 
we final get some understand of the motiv behind the `` shadow govern . `` 
there are even some subtl tie-in with contemporari ufo-olog , includ the `` grey `` and the roswel crash of 1947 . 
3 . is the movi ani good ? 
no . the x-file is a dread movi and show some fundament problem with writer/cr chri carter 's talent and the relationship between cinema and televis . 
first off , the screenplay by seri creator chri carter is sloppi and clich . 
after approxim forty-f minut ( the length of a televis episod minu the commerci ) , the pace drop to a snail 's crawl . 
not long after that point , when carter attempt to answer some question we have had about the seri , we wish he had not . 
the explan are so trite and ridicul that one would have prefer it had carter not explain quit so much . 
i am will to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurd carter want me to swallow wa just too much . 
break the suspens of disbelief destroy the movi - and listen to other fan leav the cinema , mayb the seri too . 
the explan are not onli absurd , they are tire and unorigin . 
the extraterrestri breed and gestat like those from the alien seri , and their craft look like a leftov set piec from independ day . 
note that the alien movi , id4 , and the x-file are all from 20thcenturi fox - a studio that is begin to cannib itself i think . 
the x-file is noteworthi for be the onli movi base on a televis seri to be produc while the seri wa still run . 
in compar the movi and televis seri certain aspect of the respect media emerg . 
the avoid of the seri to answer the question it rais annoy and frustrat mani peopl . 
howev , i rather like that about the seri . 
televis allow you to impos as much , or as littl , mean on a show as you want . 
it is the proverbi `` blank screen `` which we project our mind on . 
mean on televis is open and ambigu ; it is the natur of the medium . 
cinema , on the other hand , is the opposit . 
it project onto us the filmmak mind . 
we can , in some film , fill the textual gap ourselv , but that almost never happen in an american film . 
mean , in cinema , need to be self-contain and determin . 
so , when the x-file made that jump from small to big screen , carter need to take into consider the differ in the medium as well . 
he did not . 
by make explicit , what the televis show left implicit , carter reveal the limit of hi creativ and skill . 
when they say that `` fan `` make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . 
on televis , fan cultur must impos it mean on the text becaus there is noth there . 
how true that is when we see the `` explicit `` x-file - there is noth there .
