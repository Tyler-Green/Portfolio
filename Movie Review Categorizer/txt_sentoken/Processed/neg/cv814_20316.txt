`` the 13th warrior `` come at the end of as summer where we 've alreadi experienc man eat shark ( `` deep blue sea `` ) , man eat crocodil ( `` lake placid `` ) and even a man hunt witch ( `` the blair witch project `` ) . 
now , `` the 13th warrior `` present a tribe of flesh eat men who believ that they are bear . 
the stori , if that 's what you want to call it , follow ahm ibn fahdlan ( antonio bandera ) an arabian poet who fall in love with hi king 's wife and is banish from hi home land . 
he then travel to the land of the vike and becom an ambassador to them . 
eventu the vike are call upon to protect the peopl of the villag who are be hunt by the flesh eat men . 
thirteen warrior are chosen to go on the mission , and as you guess it , ahm is chosen as the thirteenth . 
he 's not a warrior , and at first not well accept by the vike , but as the movi advanc he 'll have to prove himself both on and off the battlefield . 
that 's basic the entir plot . 
there is also a romant subplot that ha been so badli mishandl and , one assum , drastic cut that you begin to wonder whi the filmmak did n't just edit out all of the scene attain to that part of the stori . 
instead they chose to leav just enough of those scene in to annoy the viewer . 
the film is basic non- stop action and when it paus and tri to develop a stori it becom a laugh stock . 
the battl scene , although well choreograph , are not involv and not the least bit excit . 
we do n't get to know ani of the charact and so we do n't care who live and who die . 
the film , which want to be beowolf , come across more as a fail action-adventur stori aspir to epic proport but not achiev it on ani level . 
it wa direct by john mctiernan who 's , `` the thoma crown affair `` is also play in theater current . 
and it 's not that mctiernan work simultan on both film but that , `` the 13th warrior `` wa place on the shelf for so long with the studio just wait for a time to dump it on audienc . 
it belong back on the shelf .
