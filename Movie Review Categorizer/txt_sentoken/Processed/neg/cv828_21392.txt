that is , unless you 're one of those peopl who have seen the preview a thousand time on tv or in the theater . 
i can tell you one thing now : they gave the entir movi away . 
whi someon would want to base an entir movi on one premis and then give that crucial detail away in the trailer is beyond me . 
howev , if they * had n't * given it away , the film would 've still been suprisingli devoid of suspens given it subject matter . 
obvious , the produc thought they could remak `` the deep end of the ocean , `` throw in tommi lee jone and a coupl of clich and call it an action drama . 
`` doubl jeopardi `` offer solid act from ashley judd and tommi lee jone , who got first bill even though he did n't see to be on screen half as much as judd did . 
it also offer some genuin funni , clever , or full-of-tens moment ( my favorit : judd wake up in the coffin ) , but none of that can salvag the film from it insan predict plot . 
half the time i 'm wonder whether i 'm watch one of those overhyp tv miniseri , which alway turn out to be less excit than advertis . 
judg by the begin , end , and a huge chunk of the middl , i might have been watch a special hallmark present too . 
the movi 's stretch for an almost two hour long film with onli 30 minut worth of materi . 
implaus materi , no less . 
loos interpret of one of the amend asid , too mani time in the movi i thought , `` that is * not * possibl * . `` 
that kind of stuff is excus in popcorn movi , but not one like `` doubl jeopardi `` that tri to pass itself off as seriou drama . 
everyth seem drag out , overplay . 
when they should 've kept us in the dark , they let the cat out of the bag too earli .
