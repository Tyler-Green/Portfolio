one of my brother 's favorit movi is h . b . halicki 's 1974 cult flick `` gone is sixti second , `` one of the best product of the car-chas genr that provid drive-in fare dure the 1970 's . 
chase pic had more tire squeal than dialogu , but they had a strong viscer appeal . 
although it boast a bigger budget and familiar star , the remak of `` gone in sixti second `` is rel weak and dull . 
randal `` memphi `` rain ( nicola cage ) is a retir car thief who run a go-cart track . 
he got out of crime so that hi younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boost car . 
howev , kip becam a thief anyway , and now he 's in big troubl . 
kip promis to deliv fifti luxuri and sport car to gangster raymond calitri ( christoph eccleston ) by the end of the week . 
calitri expect memphi to fulfil kip 's bargain ; if he doe n't come through , kip die . 
memphi gather hi old crew ( angelina joli , robert duval , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinni jone ) , and kip bring hi boy ( t . j . 
cross , william lee scott , scott caan , and jame duval ) . 
as if calitri breath down their neck wa n't bad enough , the team is pursu by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who 's still tick off that he never bust memphi and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who want to take over calitri 's client . 
watch `` gone , `` i discov that steal fifti car is not ani more interest than steal one . 
mayb that 's whi the first forty-nin are fairli easi , and the thrill are save for `` eleanor , `` a 1967 shelbi gto , a model that ha alway elud memphi . 
but the big chase doe n't live up to the long wait . 
i had high hope for `` gone `` becaus it is director domin sena 's second film . 
`` kalifornia , `` hi 1993 debut , wa a brilliant studi in the relationship between violenc and it audienc . 
in that movi sena took a simpl thriller plot ( a coupl give a serial killer a ride ) and success endow it with deeper signific . 
in `` gone `` he seem to be aim for a drama about two brother who ca n't commun with each other , but that goal just doe n't mesh with thi plot . 
`` gone `` either take itself too serious or not serious enough . 
it 's not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intens . 
thi chaser ha more dialogu than tire squeal but is none the better for it . 
the lack of action is a wast of the premis , which should have challeng the filmmak to creat the most spectacular car chase ever . 
the weak script is a wast of a talent cast . 
in a `` newsweek `` interview last year , sean penn blast hi old pal nic cage for make bad movi . 
much as i like cage , for everi good pictur he doe ( `` leav la vega , `` `` bring out the dead `` ) , there are two major stinker ( `` snake eye , `` `` con air , `` `` 8mm , `` `` citi of angel `` ) . 
that ratio is probabl better than what a lot of hi peer can boast , but cage ha real talent . 
it 's a shame to wast it in glitzi , superfici tripe like `` gone in 60 second . ``
