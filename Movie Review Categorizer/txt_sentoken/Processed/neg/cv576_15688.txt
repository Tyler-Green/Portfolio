so much for sweet return . 
after smart horror film were start to be made again after the exploit 80 's slasher movi , start with 1996 's `` scream , `` and follow by `` scream 2 , `` `` urban legend , `` and the origin , `` i know what you did last summer , `` a film like , `` i still know what you did last summer , `` wa bound to be made sooner or late . 
it is a perfect exampl of the exact reason whi horror film temporarili burn out , and that is becaus they reach for the lowest-common-denomin in filmmak , favor non-stop death and gore for suspens , and trade in flesh out , likabl charact for one-dimension nitwit . 
it ha been exactli one year sinc juli jame ( jennif love hewitt ) suffer through the ordeal of be terror by ben willi , a psychopath fisherman whom her friend and she accident hit in the middl of the road , and then , think he wa dead , dump him into the ocean . 
sinc then , juli ha reloc to boston univers , and although often paranoid and haunt by bad dream , she ha been abl to put her life back togeth . 
when juli 's friend , karla ( brandi ) , is call up by a radio station and answer correctli what the capit of brazil is , she win a vacat to the bahama for four peopl , which also includ karla 's horni boyfriend , tyrel ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settl ) , who karla set juli up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddi prinz jr . , also return from the origin ) , doe n't show up . 
when they reach the seclud island , they discov it is the last day of the open season , and will be strand there for the 4th of juli weekend with a few employe to fend off a violent storm head for them . 
of cours , juli , her friend , and the worker are n't the onli one there , as the murder ben willi , dress in fisherman garb , return to seek reveng on juli onc and for all . 
it is a sad state of affair when a movi like , `` i still know what you did last summer , `` is made . 
i am a veri big fan of horror movi , and so it is especi dishearten to find out that thi sequel to `` ikwydl , `` which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a `` friday the 13th `` movi . 
while the origin focus more on the stori and charact , as well as genuin suspens moment , thank to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who did n't return to write the sequel , and it show ) , `` i still know . . . `` 
ha no stori to speak of , and is so vacuou of idea , that the filmmak , were forc to have a murder occur everi five minut just to keep the audienc interest . 
also gone are ani sign of charact develop , and sinc everi singl charact die befor i got to know them , all i wa left with wa to stare at the screen , indiffer to what wa go on . 
while i care about the fate of the charact in the origin , it made no differ to me in thi sequel who live and die . 
they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to becom victim to the lethal hook of the fisherman . 
anoth element that made the origin so memor were some superbl craft set-piec , like the store sequenc with sarah michel gellar , but there are none to speak of in thi sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandi ) . 
sinc so mani peopl were kill everi coupl minut , the suspens and scare evapor faster than salt in water . 
also of note is the mysteri of the second killer , and accomplic to ben , but it is obviou from the first frame who it is , and so i could n't even have fun at that , like i did in the `` scream `` movi and , `` urban legend . `` 
it figur that just as slasher film were start to get some recognit again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyon els . 
mayb the peopl who made , `` i still know what you did last summer , `` should have realiz that in order to make a good movi , you must have a screenplay -- -or at least one that is n't such a black hole for thought and idea . 
the end of the film inevit leav the door wide open for a third part , but judg from thi amazingli lacklust first sequel , everyon involv should have quit while they were still ahead .
