plot : token director alan smithe steal the onli copi of hi film `` trio `` from the studio , after they complet the `` final cut `` without him . 
he threaten to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep hi vision . 
critiqu : wow . 
i realli ca n't rememb the last time a movi suck on so mani level ! 
the `` comedi `` in thi film is pathet , obviou and date ( oj simpson joke galor ) . 
the plot is uninterest , bore and bad . 
the structur of the film is annoy , repetit and pretenti . 
the act is pretti bad , especi jacki chan , who ca n't act to save hi life . 
the cameo are lame and seem forc , and the end blow chunk . 
all in all , thi movi believ itself to be a clever , humor and edgi look behind the close door of hollywood , but come across as a bore , stupid and complet unentertain piec of shite . 
i love to see movi about hollywood shenanigan , but thi one bite the big one . 
see it if you like to watch realli bad movi , otherwis skip it , becaus it will just have you hate everi star that make an appear in it . 
luckili for us all , thi mess onli last about 80 minut , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein play a lead-fac detect . 
by the way , is there ani reason whi the studio or the produc could n't have cut anoth version of the film by the way of all the film stock that wa left over ?
