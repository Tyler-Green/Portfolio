`` mafia ! `` - crime is n't a funni busi by homer yen ( c ) 1998 
on a particular night when i found myself have some free time , i had a chanc to either go to sleep earli or to see `` mafia ! `` , a spoof of mafia and crime film such as `` the godfath , `` `` goodfella `` and `` casino `` . 
at 84 minut in length , i thought that i could enjoy a few laugh befor get a good night sleep . 
but by my account , i think that my laff-o-met onli regist a few grin , one giggl , and mayb one chortl . 
i suppos that you could justifi your time as homag to the vener hollywood star , lloyd bridg , who just recent pass away and whose last perform wa in thi film . 
`` mafia ! `` 
chronicl vincenzo cortino 's ( lloyd bridg ) life . 
separ from hi famili when he wa young , he escap to america and tri to live an honest life . 
but as fate would have it , vincenzo grow up to be a power and klutzi crime lord . 
follow in hi footstep are hi two son , joey ( billi burk ) and anthoni ( jay mohr ) . 
like all sibl in power crime famili , they squabbl over power , the futur of the famili , fortun , and women . 
`` mafia ! `` is co-written by jim abraham , who also contribut to some gut-bust funni spoof such as `` airplan `` and `` the nake gun . `` 
but these previou movi were funni becaus the joke seem more univers understood and there wa more of a manic silli at work . 
as i write thi , i also wonder how mani peopl have actual seen the movi on which thi spoof is base . 
crime movi in gener contain a lot of profan and violenc . 
it 's a tough genr to parodi . 
i wa kind of hope that they could somehow spoof the profan use in all of those crime movi , mayb by have all of the tough crime lord say `` pleas `` as they decid which sector to take over , but thi opportun wa never explor . 
there were one or two moment that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is danc with hi newli wed daughter-in-law . 
a gunman shoot him sever time . 
the impact of the bullet caus him to make these wild contort that forc the wed band to chang music style to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena . 
i think that i just gave away the best part of the film . 
oh well , that just mean that you can go to sleep a littl earlier .
