i look at the `` internet movi databas `` 's award section for thi film , and found that thi wa nomin for a golden globe for `` best pictur ( drama ) . `` 
anyon who 's seen thi film can back me up on thi : thi is the worst of the `` great `` disast film , and that 's not realli say a lot for thi film . 
`` earthquak `` is basic notabl becaus it origin includ some theatr thing where the theatr shook when the big earthquak occur . 
on video , it 's a bland and slow-mov film which give us a bunch of differ charact ( the disast film requisit ) , then bring them togeth in the struggl against the big disast . 
while thi work in , say , `` the tower inferno , `` it doe n't here for one singl reason : we do n't care about ani of the charact . 
the film give us charlton heston ( in one of mani crap 70 film he made , includ `` skyjack `` and that classic , `` soylent green `` ) as a rich man marri to ava gardner , who is have a littl affair with a young singl mom ( genievev bujold ) ; a renegad polic offic on suspens ( georg kennedi , in hi least humor perform ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycl stuntman ( richard roundtre , right after hi `` shaft `` thing ) whose big stunt is he goe on a littl track that goe upsid down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a militari man/bag boy at a groceri store who ha a littl thing for buxom victoria princip , and eventu get vengeanc on those guy who made fun of hi hair ( ! ! ! ) . 
in smaller subplot , there 's a pointless bit about peopl who are fli over l . a . ( the citi in the film , by the way ) , one who 's play card and marri to a bore non-act husband ( you think thi one can go nowher ? 
guess again . he get interest in the final frame ) ; there 's genievev bujold 's moron son , who ha a littl adventur with wire ; and for some much-need comedi , there 's walter matthau ( bill as walter mutha . . . . 
- the onli laugh in the film ) , as a wild drunkard , who 's big moment is a danc he doe at a critic time . 
as for the actual `` earthquak , `` it 's rather a let-down . 
there 's a full hour of character-setup , none of which is interest , then about 10 minut of shake , crumbl , and a bit where a hous almost fall on bujold ( narrowli miss ) . 
thi film need that whole theatre-shak : they need to wake everybodi up becaus they were so bore . 
there 's littl suspens follow the quak , although thi film tri for it . 
there 's an adventur in a crumbl high-ris offic build , the wire with the kid , and the movement of peopl who are all injur . 
but none of these are all-too suspens . 
the final with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangl is end in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit , which bring out a big let-down . 
and there 's no real final . 
even `` volcano `` end nice , and that movi realli suck . 
not onli is it hokey , but you do n't care about ani charact . 
who care if heston die ? 
who care if he chose bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner , mainli on the basi that she can actual act ) ? 
who care if richard roundtre make money on hi stupid `` stunt ? `` 
who care if that idiot kid fall to hi death on some wire ? 
and who care about that whole plane spiel ? 
if anyth , `` earthquak `` is worth a view for the same reason `` glen or glenda ? `` 
is . 
i mean , i laugh at thi more than i did at `` bio dome . `` 
but that 's anoth stori ( and review ) . 
in short , `` earthquak `` give disast pic a bad name .
