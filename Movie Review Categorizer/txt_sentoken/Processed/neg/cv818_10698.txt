ok , i admit it -- i find camp amus with the spice girl . 
ye , the same spice girl of the gimmicki individu `` ident , `` they of the annoyingli infecti bubblegum pop hook and cheesi unifi mantra of `` girl power . `` 
but not even their guilti pleasur appeal is n't enough to carri their big screen debut , a junki mess which would be more aptli name shite world than spice world . 
the film begin amusingli enough , with a cheeki 007-esqu titl sequenc in which the british quintet -- `` scari `` ( melani brown ) , `` babi `` ( emma bunton ) , `` sporti `` ( melani chisolm ) , `` ginger `` ( geri halliwel ) , and `` posh `` ( victoria adam ) -- are introduc one by one ( to , much to my surpris , excit and onli slightli mock cheer from the press audienc ) as they croon the silki ballad `` too much `` ( a tune that would sound right at home in an actual jame bond film ) . 
a few minut and an elton john cameo later come an introductori tour of the numer plotlin that run through the film : ( 1 ) the spici one go on a european public tour lead up to their first live concert at london 's royal albert hall ; ( 2 ) a film produc ( georg wendt ) and a screenwrit ( mark mckinney ) pitch variou film idea to the girl ' manag , clifford ( richard e . grant ) ; ( 3 ) a documentari film crew follow the girl ; ( 4 ) a pregnant `` mate `` ( naoki mori ) of the group rapidli approach her due date ; and ( 5 ) a tabloid publish ( barri humphri ) attempt to destroy the group with the help of a sneaki shutterbug ( richard o'brien ) . 
cap off by a live rendit of the girl ' bounci hit `` say you 'll be there , `` a wealth of laugh and merriment is sure to follow , right ? 
wrong . it 's all downhil from there as spice world collaps into a seri of misfir comedi sketch . 
i must give the girl credit for their refresh willing to make fun of themselv , but writer kim fuller and director bob spier can bare come up with a funni joke between them , much less a organ framework for all the `` wacki `` goings-on . 
spice world jump from vignett to vignett , subplot to subplot with no direct and littl sens , at one minut have the girl meet with alien ( no joke ) and at anoth have them stage a dare rescu of two young fan who fall into the water dure a boat ride . 
while a decent joke slip through the crack here and there -- dure a `` danc bootcamp `` scene , the girl sing the lyric `` we know how we got thi far/strength and courag and a wonderbra `` -- much of the materi is not even funni on the chuckl level . 
some gag are just plain pointless , such as roger moor 's recur role as the mysteri chief , who dispens cryptic , metaphor-heavi advic to clifford . 
the onli reason whi i can think anyon would find that funni is the fact that moor onc play jame bond . 
ha ha . 
as weak as the script is , i think there 's one insurmount problem with even attempt to make a spice girl movi , and that is the girl themselv . 
the point is not that they ca n't act ( and , for the record , they realli _can't_ ) but that their individu persona , which work as a gimmick over the span of a four-minut music video , are too thin to surviv outsid of the truncat , video bite mtv world . 
posh ( who garner the most enthusiast cheer dure the introduct ) come off best by default becaus her persona ( rich bitch ) most easili translat into charact in a film . 
babi 's persona ( young innoc ) , to a lesser extent , also work , but the remain girl ' ident are a littl harder to flesh out . 
there realli is n't much to do with sporti besid have her exercis everi so often ( which is _exactly_ what fuller and spier do ) , and , after all , what exactli entail be `` ginger `` or `` scari `` ? 
appar , just their wardrob . 
spice world manag to pick up some steam in the late go follow a flashback perform of the spice ' signatur hit , `` wannab . `` 
the song is as grate as ever , but the energi of the number give the proceed a much-need shot in the arm , set the stage for a wave of self-referenti humor stem from the screenwrit ' film idea ( the film almost mirror robert altman 's the player in the way the film snail into itself ) . 
thi section of the film , involv all manner of derring-do involv a speed bu , is perhap it most effect , but it also point up how all the other storylin ( the publish , the documentari crew ) lack a satisfactori payoff . 
spice world is harmless entertain suitabl for the entir famili , and it will pleas the spice faith . 
but thi sloppi enterpris sure wo n't win them ani new fan , which is what the group sore need to bolster it rapidli wane girl power in the state . 
onc the hype disappear , spice world will like serv as the the spice ' final hurrah in america .
