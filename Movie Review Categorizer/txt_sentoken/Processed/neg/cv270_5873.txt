for time reason have to do with babi sitter , we recent went to a multiplex and saw undercov blue . 
i would give it one half of a star for gut . 
anyon in a movi thi bad would have to have gut . 
i later read a ny time review that said kathleen turner and denni quaid had gotten so plump they look like they had the mump in the show . 
the script wa the worst part . 
they had charact who talk with funni accent in an attempt to make you laugh . 
they had lot of `` great `` sight gag like two peopl tri to go in a door togeth and therefor bump shoulder against the door . 
turner and quaid both kept smile like some idiot on a game show . 
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left . 
buy some ticket and give them to your worst enemi . 
tell them the show is great and smile a lot . 
* * * * = one of the top few film of thi or ani year . 
a must see film . 
* * * = excel show . 
look for it . 
* * = averag movi . 
kind of enjoy . 
* = poor show . 
do n't wast your money . 
0 = one of the worst film of thi or ani year . 
total unbear .
