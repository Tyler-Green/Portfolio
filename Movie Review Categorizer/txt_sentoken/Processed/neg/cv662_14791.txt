capsul : five friend at a stag parti are involv in the accident kill of a prostitut . 
the cover-up attempt becom a monster that eat up the friend , two wive and sever innoc bystand . 
thi wa a real audienc pleaser at toronto , but it did not do much for me . 
, low 0 ( -4 to +4 ) 
- direct by peter berg who act in the last seduct and copland . 
- five buddi go on a stag outing to la vega while cameron diaz work through the logist of her upcom wed to one of them . 
one of the buddi accident kill a prostitut . 
- sever peopl with no moral compass . 
they start out with a simpl , innoc littl cocain parti ( ! ) and by accid look what happen . 
they have one moral person among them ( daniel stern ) , and one total amor person ( christian slater ) . 
it is more selfish to let the amor lead , so they do . 
- thi film is strang , but not realli funni or bite . 
black comedi should actual be funni as well as strang . 
there should be some element of satir . 
the satir is miss here . 
i did not find myself laugh here either . 
what we have is a strang crime tale . 
- one just doe not care what happen to these peopl . 
- the same idea of peopl just get themselv in deeper and deeper ha been done frequent . 
if thi film is popular it is just bring a familiar plot to a new gener . 
- it begin like diner ( particularli with daniel stern ) and end up like an extend horror/crim comic book . 
- there are sever logic hole in script . 
if a secur man goe to investig a complaint and disappear , would n't the guest he wa investig be the first suspect ? 
someon frame for a crime in the way shown would be judg innoc after minim forens detect work . 
( i am desper tri to avoid make thi a spoiler . ) 
- popular and situat ethic get a real slam . 
- some act of grief is hammi and overdon . 
more yell than humor .
