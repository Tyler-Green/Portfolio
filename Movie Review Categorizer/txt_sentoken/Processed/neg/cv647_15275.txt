the first in a veri long list of thing wrong with `` i still know what you did last summer `` is the titl . 
think about it for a second . 
if the last movi wa call `` i know what you did last summer `` , would n't the next movi have to be `` i still know what you did two summer ago `` ? 
if anyon work on thi movi had an i . q . 
greater than five would have thought about it logic and said , `` hey . . . 
wait a minut `` . 
but ala , the peopl behind thi film are obvious idiot , so i wo n't hold them to that . 
what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretti bad movi on their hand , even for a teenag slasher flick . 
i guess i 'm one of the few critic who actual kind of like the origin film ( emphasi on the `` kind of `` ) . 
it wa n't great or anyth and mayb not even necessarili good , but at least it did n't have me glanc at my watch everi minut or so like it 's sequel did . 
there are just so mani problem with thi movi that it 's hard tri to figur out where to start . 
first of all , i guess , is the set . 
the movi offer no ration reason whi the film had to take place in the bahama , other than the fact that the produc want a seasid set . 
exactli whi doe the fisherman want to go through all the troubl of fake a radio contest to get juli jame ( jennif love hewitt , one of the onli survivor of the first film ) and her new colleg buddi out to the island befor he hack them up ? 
the movi suffer from thi kind of logic all the way through . 
in one scene , juli is in a tan booth at a desert gym when the hook fisherman with the slicker come in and seal up the booth so the damsel in distress ca n't get out , no matter how hard she tri . 
when juli discov she 's go to slowli fri to death , she scream for help and her friend come to her rescu . 
now , thi is all fine and dandi except for one thing ; instead of spend five minut tri to bust open the booth , whi not just turn the freakin ' thing off ? 
in anoth scene , one of the charact , after have their signific other all but decapit by the man in the slicker , say to juli , `` just do n't tell anybodi it rain the whole time . `` 
oh yeah , i 've just been terror by a hook wield sociopath and had some of my best friend gruesom slaughter , but hey , i 'll crack joke anyway . 
after all , it is in the script . 
the film 's onli save grace are a few well-execut suspens sequenc and a realli cool cameo by the `` re-anim himself , jeffrey comb . 
he bring some good comic relief and life to an otherwis limp movi . 
way to go , jeffrey . 
i have a hunch that the reason thi film fizzl while the first one at least kept it 's head abov water is the recent absenc of writer kevin williamson . 
with `` scream `` and even it 's sequel , he display a real talent as a screenwrit . 
hi ear for dialogu and the terrif end he put on all hi film make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writer , and i think `` i still know `` ha realli suffer by not have him on board . 
the cool atmospher is still there thi time around , but i just did n't like the charact or the write as much as i did in the first one . 
even though the movi doe n't have williamson , it still ha a hacki end , tri to do what kevin did with the first two `` scream `` s by ( some may consid thi a spoiler , but if you have seen ani horror movi whatsoev , then you should be abl to guess the ident of the madman within twenti minut ) have two killer and , thi time , have one of them be a famili member to the other . 
i think someon in the audienc put it best when , after the movi had end with anoth `` the killer is back ! `` 
cliffhang , he said `` who is thi time , the grandma ? `` 
all in all , `` i still know `` tri to be as success as the first the film wa , but realli fail in the attempt . 
i mean , it 's okay when slasher movi rip-off each other , but when they start copi themselv . . .
