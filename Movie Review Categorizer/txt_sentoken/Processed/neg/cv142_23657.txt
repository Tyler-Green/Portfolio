deuc bigalow ( rob schneider ) clean fish tank . 
yeah , i did n't know that wa a real job either . 
one of hi custom is antoin lecont ( ode fehr ) , a success gigolo . 
when antoin ha to go to sweden for three week , he let deuc use hi hous to look after an ail $ 800 fish . 
fool around , deuc set fire to the kitchen and smash a $ 6000 fish tank . 
after take a tri at one of antoin 's client and earn $ 10 , deuc decid to prostitut himself to rais the money to replac the fish tank befor the fiery-temp antoin return . 
enter t . j . ( eddi griffin ) , a pimp for `` man-whor , `` who arrang for deuc to servic an assort of women whose imperfect keep them from date . 
there 's an enorm woman ( play by transvestit porn star chi chi la rue ) who hide food in her cloth . 
there 's clair ( gail o'gradi ) whose narcolepsi caus her to fall asleep everi few minut . 
tina ( torsten voge ) is so tall her face doe n't fit on the screen , and ruth ( ami poehler ) ha tourett 's syndrom and shout obscen without warn . 
final there 's kate ( arija bareiki ) whose soror sister secretli paid her fare . 
she seem perfect , and deuc quickli fall in love with her . 
( she doe , we discov later , have an imperfect , but deuc decid it is n't import . ) 
deuc 's life is complic by a bothersom cop ( william forsyth ) look for inform on antoin and by kate 's discoveri of hi man-whor . 
howev , neither threat gener much suspens . 
the formula is so familiar that we know how it will end from the start . 
`` deuc bigalow `` is the first project from adam sandler 's compani happi madison , the format of which assur that we 'll be see the sandler style of comedi mass-produc at an increas rate in year to come . 
be afraid . 
be veri afraid . 
the good news is that sandler doe n't actual appear in `` deuc `` and that rob schneider and eddi griffin are funnier than sandler . 
schneider ha a sweet that make the clueless but good-heart deuc believ . 
griffin 's deliveri is dead-on , especi in the coin of `` technic term `` for t . j . 's profess , as in `` do n't make me he-bitch man-slap you ! `` 
there 's the expect amount of toilet humor in `` deuc . `` 
( for one thing , deuc 's dad is a men 's room attend ) . 
doe anyon over the age of eight actual find bowel movement that funni ? 
for most of us , i think that childhood fascin with bodili function disappear when we hit the far-sid of puberti and discov how funni sex is . 
i , for one , will be glad when the toilet trend is final flush . 
bottom line : `` deuc `` doe n't offer anyth new but it is intermitt funni .
