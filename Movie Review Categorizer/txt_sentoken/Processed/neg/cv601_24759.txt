so i went and saw thi film right , it wa call `` battlefield : earth `` , i wa never interest in the preview , and never too terribl interest in the book , nor do i find scientolog interest , but after read advanc review of how bad thi film realli is , i had that weird urg just to watch it . 
well let me be the first to say , and so far in my view it 's safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen , ye even wors than `` mr . magoo `` , `` blue in the face `` , or `` jaw : the reveng `` . 
roger christianson who credit includ set direct , and art direct for such great film as `` alien `` and `` star war `` , direct thi film with such amateur , that the film look and feel and in fact sound so dumb , that it 's quit depress . 
the look of the film , is dark and drabbi at time , but then bright and happi at other time . 
the sound is terribl , and ha the worst surround sound effect i 've heard . 
the act is noth , the dialogu poor , and the make-up effect hideou . 
here 's the so-cal plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endang speci , while alien from the planet psychlo ( the alien are name psychlo . . . i 
wonder whi ? ! ) are invad earth , destin to put an end to those `` man-anim `` to an end , and destroy earth onc and for all , of cours we have our typic hero ( play terribl by barri pepper , who wa great in a small role in 1999 's `` the green mile `` ) who is destin to go out , and save hi planet ! 
one thing : he ha to go up against , terl , the chief of secur psychlo , who is play frankli , quit bad by john travolta , whom with dreadlock , a big head , and green eye just doe n't work . 
of cours the sidekick to terl , is play by ( lol ! ! ) 
forest whitak , who look like a deform werewolf of some kind . 
our friendli human johnni ( barri pepper ) look just as bad as well , with long scraggli hair . 
i 'm not realli sure how to quit explain the bad of thi film , except just to say it 's terribl . 
everyth in thi film is imcomprehins , from the make-up effect , which by the way are n't good , to the phoni look special effect , everyth in thi film is fault . 
in fact i do n't rememb one part in thi entir movi where i wa have a good time , or enjoy myself . 
in fact there is no part in the movi that i like or enjoy . 
throughout the entir 127 minut run time , i wa die , constantli look at my watch , and hope mayb the projection would blow a bulb or someth , sadli it did n't . 
my advic to hollywood : get new script , new act class , better director and damnit , make film like american beauti more .
