there 's a scene somewher in thi film where one of the charact read the book `` screenwrit made easi . `` 
thi is funni the first time just 'caus it is , but funnier as the film goe on sinc it 's total iron sinc the screenwrit of thi inan film probabl read it , outlin it and then wrote thi film . 
it 's like they took the sub-genr of the disast pic , which can be fun and hokey at the same time , and then forgot one of the greatest part of them : the stupid , eccentr charact . 
ye , `` the poseidon adventur `` is crap , but it 's fun 'caus of all the stupid , eccentr charact . 
and `` earthquak , `` my god ! 
`` earthquak `` ha got to be one of the worst movi of all time , but at least they had the joke of have charlton heston sleep with geneviev bujold . 
`` volcano `` take a semi-intrigu yet stupend inan plot ( a volcano no one knew about suddenli errupt one fine morn and then erupt again later then stop . . . onli 
it 's in , dare i say it ? 
l . a ! ! ! ) and then put no stupid , stereotyp , eccentr charact in it . 
they 're just stupid . 
and the actor are all good one . 
tommi lee jone is great , an oscar winner , and a member of the men in black ( my vote for what should be the coolest movi of the summer ) . 
ann hech is a good indi actress . 
don cheadl stole the disappoint `` devil in a blue dress `` from denzel 's feet . 
and gabi 's one of the few good teenag actor . 
but they get noth to do but act dumb and scream at what 's go on . 
they do their best , god bless them , but they 're all lost in the fake magma ( onli don cheadl get an interest part and he 's the greatest part of the film ) . 
there 's no real suspens here 'caus you do n't care about anyon . 
i actual wa root for gabi 's charact to get kill so tommi lee jone would n't have to keep save her ( he did it like thirti time ! ) . 
and there are no interest site in l . a . that we see get destroy . 
part of the fun of disast film is watch site get toppl or destroy or whatev . 
in `` independ day , `` the best part ( other than judd hirsch ) wa watch the white hous and empir state build get blown up by the alien . 
that wa cool . 
watch realli fake-look magma plow down the street is not . 
okay , so the film 's not devoid of merit . 
as i alreadi state , don cheadl wa great and the cast doe their best . 
and there 's thi realli moron scene which look cool . 
john carrol lynch ( norm from `` fargo `` ) goe on a subway car to save peopl but the lava come and surround it . 
he ha one guy who 's wound and could make it . 
he could throw the guy and jump and still surviv . 
but no ! ! ! 
he ha to go and inan jump and land right in the middl of the lava . 
here 's the cool sight : he melt . 
here 's the dumb part of it : he somehow manag to throw the man to safeti as hi leg are melt . 
cool sight . 
no logic . 
but cool sight . 
the volcano erupt twice and for some reason , the film end there . 
they are n't worri about it erut again , they just go home to their toppl home . 
but to tell the truth , i wa glad they did n't go on . 
i wa hope the film wa over after the first erupt end . 
my god , it wa actual pain to sit through thi littl 102 minut long film . 
i have n't seen `` dant 's peak `` but i 've heard it 's a masterpiec compar to thi . 
if you want to see a cool disast flick that 's inan but interest , rent `` the tower inferno `` with steve mcqueen , paul newman , and the schweppervesc o . j . 
simpson ( he save a cat ) . 
if you want to wast your time watch a bore , stupid disast flick ( liter , it almost gross half of it budget ) , see thi . 
but i warn you .
