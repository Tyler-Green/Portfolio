`` what 's your favorit new york moment ? `` 
`` thi one 's climb the chart . `` 
star john cusack , kate beckinsal , eugen levi , molli shannon . 
direct by peter chelsom . 
rate pg-13 . 
there 's no doubt that 95 % of romant comedi follow a distinct pattern : guy see girl , guy want girl , guy goe through unreason obstacl to get girl , guy get girl . 
in rare case , the gender are flip . 
predict is a given . 
rare , though , is a romant comedi as cheap , as obviou , or as pointless as serendip , a film that use it `` theme `` as an excus for it plot contriv . 
`` lightweight `` doe n't begin to describ it . 
thi is like anti-grav . 
it begin in a new york citi bloomingdal 's , a product placement that rival cast away 's fedex for sheer blatanc . 
jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thoma ( kate beckinsal ) both go for the same pair of glove . 
after go through the perfunctori motion , jonathan get to keep the glove and the two of them go out for ice cream , follow by ice skate . 
jonathan fall hard , and sara is charm . 
when she write her name and number down on a piec of paper , a truck rumbl by and blow it out of her hand . 
she take thi as a sign from fate that they should n't be togeth ; jonathan is flabbergast . 
to pacifi him , she come up with an idea : jonathan will write hi number on a 5 dollar bill , which she will promptli spend . 
when she get home , she will write her name and number insid a book ( `` love in the time of cholera `` ) and sell it to a use bookstor . 
if the bill get back to her or the book to him , it will mean that they are meant to be togeth . 
three year later . 
both sara and jonathan are now engag to other love interest . 
both realiz they are n't content . 
both go look for the other . 
what happen now is so absurd that i 'm almost tempt to recommend the film for the sake of see it . 
the two of them run circl around each other in a set of incred `` coincid `` that i would describ as contriv if it were n't for the film oh-so-cleverli dismiss that critic by build it plot around `` serendip . `` 
of cours , sinc the movi is about fate , the screenwrit can do anyth he damn well pleas . 
i 'm not buy it . 
there 's no suspens in ani of thi becaus we know exactli what 's go to happen , but serendip insist on drill it purportedli `` ador `` non-stori into our head . 
instead of `` will they meet ? `` 
the question we 're ask is `` when will they meet alreadi ? `` 
to make matter wors , everi `` coincid `` is telegraph from a mile away ; by the last reel i wa bore enough to activ look for sign that someth els `` incred `` wa go to happen . 
cusack is fine and beckinsal , at least , is n't saddl with anoth lumber , clunki screenplay ( she 's had bad luck , what with brokedown palac and pearl harbor on her resum ) , just an inan pointless one . 
serendip also reliev the tedium with the amaz eugen levi , who play a snarki bloomingdal 's salesman . 
what 's the interest in watch a movi that spiral around and around a predestin ( no pun intend ) conclus ? 
serendip want to tug at the heartstr , but it onli test our patienc .
