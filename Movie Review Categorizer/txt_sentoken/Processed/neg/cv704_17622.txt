after 1993 's `` fall down , `` i hope that joel schumach would matur into a great director . 
sinc then he ha offer us two so-so adapt of john grisham novel ( `` the client `` and `` a time to kill `` ) and two batman movi that lower the standard of that franchis . 
although these disappoint dampen my enthusiasm for schumach 's potenti , the public for hi latest releas , `` 8mm , `` rais new hope . 
it promis to be someth unusu . 
it wa n't . 
the plot goe like thi : tom well ( nicola cage ) is a privat eye who is hire by a wealthi woman , allegor name mr . christian ( myra carter ) , to investig an 8mm movi found among her late husband 's belong . 
the movi appear to be a snuff film in which a teenag girl is rape and murder by a man in a leather mask ( who remind me of bane in schumach 's `` batman & robin `` ) . 
becaus murder can be realist simul in movi , mr . christian want tom to discov if the girl is aliv or dead . 
by comb through miss person report , tom find the girl 's name and track her to lo angel . 
with the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and anoth symbol name ) , tom wander through the underworld of pornographi in search of snuff . 
the plot bear an obviou resembl to paul schrader 's `` hardcor , `` in which a father goe deeper and deeper into the industri of porn and sex to find hi miss daughter . 
both film are model on dant 's `` the inferno , `` of cours ; `` 8mm `` make that connect overli obviou by cast max as virgil and have him constantli tell tom that they were head toward a meet with the devil . 
`` hardcor `` is a much more subtl and meaning film . 
`` 8mm `` had a lot of promis . 
in it better moment it 's an examin of violenc as entertain and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . 
one moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he 's read truman capot 's `` in cold blood `` underneath the cover of a porn novel . 
`` in cold blood `` wa the father of the true-crim genr , which is the literari equival of snuff film . 
max promis that we will see exampl of the second theme when he tell tom , `` danc with the devil and the devil do n't chang ; the devil chang you . `` 
tom doe change-i 'll let you discov the specif for yourself-but not perman . 
schumach and screenwrit andrew kevin walker did n't have the gut to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he could n't come back . 
( walker 's `` seven `` did a much better job on that theme by refus to compromis ) . 
cage tri hard to pull it off , but the script doe n't give him enough to work with . 
phoenix walk away with the movie-h 's smart , charm , and funni . 
other cast member includ `` fargo `` 's peter stormar camp it up as porn auteur dino velvet and `` the soprano `` 's jame gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who push tom too far . 
in the last analysi , sinc `` 8mm `` fall short of it pretens and it promis , it just anoth privat eye stori in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradit of have the detect uncov the deprav behind the glossi facad of wealth and privileg . 
howev , unlik other predict fare in the genre-last year 's `` twilight , `` for example- `` 8mm `` is especi disappoint becaus it could have been much more than it is .
