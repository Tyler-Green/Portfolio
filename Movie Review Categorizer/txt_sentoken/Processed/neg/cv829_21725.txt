i had an epiphani today . 
it occur to me while i wa watch `` hous on haunt hill . `` 
it is as follow : if a trailer make the film it 's advertis look like a trashi , stupid movi , well guess what ? 
chanc are , there * is * truth in advertis . 
too bad i did n't trust my own instinct when something-or-the-oth possess me to see thi movi . 
i blame it on my sudden crave for a scare and my anticip of `` sleepi hollow . `` 
that and `` dogma `` start too late in the afternoon for my schedul . 
an hour of `` angel `` or `` buffi `` is scarier than thi doozi that tri to be scari and shtick but fall flat on it face . 
i wish i 'd seen it when it wa halloween . 
at least i would have been forgiv . 
hey , ti the season . 
the movi wa scari ( albeit veri confus , dizzi , and nauseat ) at first , but soon the horror got repetit and downright laughabl becaus the film obvious wa n't go anywher . 
now i truli appreci film like `` scream , `` `` halloween , `` or ani old hitchcock film where the scari stem from situat that are at least somewhat realist . 
that 's what spook peopl out , the fact that it could happen to them or someon they know . 
there ha to be a logic preced for the situat they want to scare us with . 
sure , utterli unpredict is good , too , but that 's differ from utterli nonsens . 
hohh ( hous on haunt hill ) , on the other hand . 
. 
. 
well let 's just say i about fell off my chair laugh when they oh-so-cleverli reveal that everyon who got invit to the parti wa relat to the psycho doctor who die in the hous a coupl of decad ago . 
riiiiight . 
y'know , that just send chill down my spine . 
yeah . 
just like i wet my pant when they told me the hous is evil . 
ooooooo . 
hint : blood and gut onli work a few time . 
sooner or later peopl start to tell themselv that it 's just ketchup and prop and you 've got to come up with someth better than that . 
there were just too mani thing in thi movi that we 've all seen befor ; from the inevit `` plot develop `` of stranger unwittingli trap togeth ; stranger turn against each other ; the evil manifest itself ; the dead come back for a last scare . 
each wa more predict than the last . 
whi did n't these fool just stay togeth in one place anyway ? 
sheesh . 
wa i gross out ? 
ye . 
did i get spook a few time ? 
ye . 
but whi ? 
i get realli disturb when there is no whi . 
when there were n't random scare that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wa n't that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film wa fill with drab , laughabl dialogu . 
the charact were incred flat and clich . 
not to mention downright annoy . 
you 've got a bunch of peopl go nowher in their live ; of cours they 're dumb enough to go to a parti some stranger invit them to provid they win a million dollar if they surviv the night . 
jeez , i thought no one fell for those `` you may alreadi be a winner `` thing anymor . 
and of cours , all three gal are babe . 
i wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of `` shine `` end up in thi movi . 
keep that up , geoff , and you 'll qualifi for the next batman ventur . 
the onli singl person i enjoy wa chri kattan becaus , well , he just crack me up . 
and famk jansen ( sp ? ) 
becaus she remind me of the delect brosnan . 
pierc brosnan ( hey , i willingli endur `` dant 's peak `` three time for him : ) . 
all right , i conced . 
there were a coupl of thing i enjoy . 
that pervert littl amus park at the begin . 
i probabl wo n't ride a rollercoast for a while . 
and the machin they use to drive geoffrey 's charact mad ( see , i do n't even rememb their name ) . 
the machin , not that stupid fishtank with nake wimmin in it . 
i kept wait and wait for that inevit twist at the end of the movi . 
it would n't have redeem the film , but at least it would have made me feel better . 
but no , they opt for the beauti sunris end . 
thank god they did n't add a kiss at the end or i would have puke . 
god , there is no hope .
