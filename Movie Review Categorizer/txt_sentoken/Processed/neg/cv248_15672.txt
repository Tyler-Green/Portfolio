vampir 's is a rude , chauvinist movi where women are portray as pawn of abus , present onli to pleasur men , feed vampir , readi to be bash or beaten - till one 's sensibl is shock by the low iq and mental of thi regress movi . 
to make matter wors , the buffoon that go hunt vampir are all redneck , and deserv to have their head bitten off , if not , their bodi carv in half . 
the dilemma of hate the ? hero ' as much as the ? villain ' , make one wish that the ? hand of god ' would suddenli appear and blast both parti into oblivion . 
jame wood portray jack crow , a man obsess with kill vampir , whose soul reason for live is base on reveng ( they kill hi parent ) , but thi is not a good excus for be more obnoxi than the vampir . 
as for adam baldwin , he is noth more than a stoog who is order to beat women when the director shout ? action ' , and the script should have been rework to avoid much offenc against the femal sex . 
as for the claim that the cathol church creat ? dracula ' , well that is the second most sacrilegi suggest , outsid the fact that priest and monk bear the brunt of the vampir furi , with enough blood spilt to make the inquisit look tame . 
an aw movi on all count , my suggest is to bring back buffi and buri thi group of incompet , rude vampir slayer .
