susan granger 's review of `` mulholland drive `` ( univers focu ) 
whatev david lynch is sell , i 'm not buy . 
from the writer/director of `` blue velvet `` and `` twin peak `` come anoth dark , mysteri thriller that open with an automobil accid on mulholland drive , the serpentin street that twist high in the hollywood hill . 
daze , a beauti brunett ( laura elena har ) emerg and stumbl down a hill , slip unobserv into a '30s-style apart as the tenant leav for a trip . 
the next morn , a dewi blond ( naomi watt ) from deep river , ontario , arriv in la with dream of stardom in her suitcas . 
her aunt own the apart and the two women meet . 
the brunett ha amnesia so the blond tri to help her discov her ident along with her latent lesbian lust . 
meanwhil , a hotshot director ( justin theroux ) , whose wife is in bed with the poolman , is forc to cast a certain actress in hi new film and there 's an assassin ( mark pellegrino ) roam the citi . 
the tortuou path of these variou charact - and other name cooki , coco and cowboy - intersect at variou point but the plot remain elus becaus , midway through the stori , lynch ha the brunett and blond play two differ women in an altern realiti , leav a huge wad of cash , a blue metal key , a paralyz mogul and a lot of question that go unansw . 
elena har and particularli naomi watt are gift actress , effect make the subtl switch . 
the same can not be said for former m . g . m . 
dancer ann miller who 's stiff and self-consci , speak - like most lynch player - in staccato tone . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` mulholland drive `` is a frenzi , frustrat 4 . origin design as an episod tv pilot , thi surreal triumph of suspens style over substanc is packag as a puzzl with sever of the key piec left out .
