there have been merchant-ivori costum drama with more of a puls than `` the mod squad , `` a self-consci `` hip `` cinemat render of the old tv seri still look upon fondli by so mani baby-boom . 
well , said `` squad `` certainli wo n't be a pleasant view experi for them or anybodi els , mayb even the teen target audienc the movi ha been gear toward . 
a contemporari take on thi decidedli '70 show doe n't exactli seem unwarr , but one wonder if the mold it accumul while wait on the shelf did n't transform into a full-blown case of botul . 
how curiou that the film begin by defin both mod and squad , insist that the latter is a group of peopl work togeth and then contradict thi definit by keep it titular trio apart for a sizeabl chunk of the run time . 
they are juli , pete and linc , reform delinqu work undercov for the lapd ( exposit put out of the way so fast that you 're like to be lost from the open moment on ) , and they are respect play by clair dane , giovanni ribisi and omar epp , talent actor each deserv of better than thi . 
their plight involv standard cop-corrupt stuff , as our would-b protagonist catch wind of an intern cover-up after their superior ( reliabl denni farina , one of the best thing here and gone so quickli ) get kill and frame for drug traffick . 
they pout a lot and eventu get crack to expos thi convolut conspiraci use surveil tactic that would impress the hardi boy and linda tripp but few other . 
when you 're suppos to be ask , `` what 's go to happen next ? `` , 
you 'll instead entertain thought like `` who are these peopl and whi should i care ? `` 
or `` are n't thriller suppos to contain thrill ? `` 
not that dane , epp and ribisi do n't give it a shot . 
dane can do the troubl teen thing in her sleep , as evidenc by `` my so-cal life , `` but she 's saddl with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to serious question her so-cal intellig . 
ditto for ribisi 's ( `` save privat ryan `` ) looney loos cannon , though at least he perform with a wild-and-crazi vigor that occasion demand attent . 
but epp - poor epp . 
epp ( `` higher learn `` ) is so short-chang he 's reduc to liter wait around for a bad guy to chase him . 
all thi sloppi can be attribut to the screenwrit , one of whom , scott silver , is also the director . 
they must think that if they dress up their stupid stori in such spiffi trap ( the look of the film is realli quit impress ) , it 'll somehow pay off , but thi `` mod squad `` plod anyway . 
charact are non-exist ; present are just some good-look young thing model cool levi and cooler attitud . 
plot hardli escap confus convent . 
and the one genr element you 'd think would be show up in gener portion - a few nifti explos , some fight , ani kind of action whatsoev - onli rare make it to thi dull gabfest . 
all those quick to put down last month 's inept but servic `` my favorit martian `` updat need to take a step back . 
here 's a small-to-big-screen translat that realli should 've stay in it former incarn , `` mod `` or not .
