the art of woo attempt to be one of those film like breakfast at tiffani 's in which the audienc is root for some sweet , vulner , irresist woman to work out her problem and to find happi . 
the problem is that helen lee who write and direct seem to have written alessa woo ( play by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulner and she is quit resist . 
alessa is a young woman who happen to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene . 
thi is some sort of altern world art scene where peopl pay ten of thousand of dollar for paint by talent beginn and dealer in these paint fli back and forth to place like switzerland . 
one of the most knowledg of the art dealer is alessa . 
she also happen to be the center of adul of her friend and everi parti ha suitor camp outsid her window . 
next door to alessa move struggl geniu artist and nativ american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) . 
he see that behind the facad that there is realli a sad littl girl within alessa who realli will not be happi with the rich art collector she is date . 
ben get emot involv with alessa . 
( as alessa so delic put it , `` we were bosom buddi , now we 're fuck buddi . `` ) 
but alessa will have to decid whether she want love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor . 
the real problem with the film seem to be helen lee 's inabl to decid what she want to be say . 
she undercut nearli everyth she want us to believ about alessa . 
alessa is look for financi secur but she make decis about larg sum of money for her client . 
thi appear to be a high profil and well-paid job . 
we are suppos to care about alessa 's feel , but she coldli refus to visit her own ail father . 
alessa can not be portray as sweet and vulner if at an art auction she turn into our man flint . 
thi is a charmless romant comedi that bet everyth it ha on the appeal of it main charact and come up double-zero . 
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .
