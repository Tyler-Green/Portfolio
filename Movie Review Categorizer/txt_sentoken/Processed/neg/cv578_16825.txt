it a stupid littl movi that tri to be clever and sophist , yet tri a bit too hard . 
with the voic of woodi allen , gene hackman , jennif lopez , sylvest stallon , and sharon stone , thi computer-anim yak-fest ( think toy stori [ 1996 ] fill with use merchandis ) is one for the ant-eat . 
the main stori is the independ of a worker name z ( allen ) . 
he want more to life than just dig away underground for the coloni . 
when he find out about `` insectopia , `` a mythic place where all insect can run free , z , along with hi coloni 's princess ( stone ) , journey out into the world to find a mean for life . 
about 15 minut into the pictur , i began to wonder what the point of the film wa . 
halfway through , i still did n't have an answer . 
by the end credit , i just gave up and ran out . 
antz is a mindless mess of poor write and even poorer voice-ov . 
allen is nonchal , while i would have guess , if i had n't seen her in the mighti and basic instinct , stone ca n't act , even in a cartoon . 
thi film is one for the bug : unfunni and extrem dull . 
hey , a bug 's life may have a good time do antz in .
