in `` the 13th warrior , `` arab poet ahm ibn fahdlan ( antonio bandera ) find himself kick out of baghdad for feel up the king 's old ladi . 
with hi translat ( screen legend omar sharif in a small role ) , ahm head north to act as ambassador to the northmen ( vike ) . 
he find a group of warrior mourn the loss of their king . 
a messeng soon arriv from anoth kingdom request assist . 
a soothsay say that thirteen warrior must answer the summon , twelv northmen and one outsid . 
thu , ahm becom the `` 13th warrior . `` 
on the trip , ahm manag to learn the vike ' languag by listen to their firesid convers . 
a bit far-fetch , it 's true , but we have to swallow it if thi flick is go to manag a few line of dialogu amidst the grunt . 
ahm , who 's call `` ibn `` by the vike , form friendship with herger the joyou ( denni storh ? i ) and the vike leader buliwyf ( vladimir kulich ) . 
when they arriv in the other kingdom , the thirteen warrior discov that they 're face an armi of supernatur cannib that live up in the cave . 
hereaft , most of the movi is battl scene : the cannib attack the vike , the vike attack the cannib , the cannib attack the . 
. 
. 
well , you get the idea . 
just to add some action , there 's also a vike vs . vike duel . 
other movi insert scene between the fight ; these scene are call charact develop . 
i suspect that `` the 13th warrior `` had a better script at one time and that it fell through the crack becaus of the tag-team direct . 
the movi start off in the hand of john mctiernan ( you 'll notic a lot of similar between `` warrior `` and mctiernan 's `` predat , `` includ the chitter jungl sound ) . 
somewher along the line , mctiernan bail and michael crichton took over . 
crichton , whose novel `` eater of the dead `` is the basi for `` warrior , `` ha direct a small assort of goofi science-fict `` thriller `` : `` westworld , `` `` coma , `` `` looker , `` `` runaway . `` 
their result of their consecut effort is a murki and pointless movi . 
perhap what `` the 13th warrior `` need more than anyth els is a villain . 
the `` eater of the dead `` are a faceless mob in blackfac . 
they have no person , and by the end they do n't even seem particularli threaten . 
the audienc ha no target toward which to channel it aggress . 
mctiernan should know about the import of an interest villain ; it wa hi `` die hard `` that made villain seem fun and attract big-nam star to the evil role in action film . 
`` the 13th warrior `` suffer from a lack of vision . 
it want to be `` predat `` meet `` braveheart `` meet `` the magnific seven `` meet `` danc with wolv . `` 
with so mani compet goal , all it can do is echo what it might have been . 
it might have been a satisfi action film . 
it might have been a beautifully-rend mediev epic . 
it might have been a thought-provok examin of the meet of cultur . 
what a shame it turn out to be noth in particular . 
bottom line : if you want to see antonio swing hi sword , rent `` the mask of zorro . ``
