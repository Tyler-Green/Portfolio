everyth in the phantom you have seen mani time befor and there is noth new present here . 
wincer display absolut no skill in set up an excit action sequenc . 
billi zane is wooden as the hero . 
kristi swanson is given veri littl to do , and doe veri littl with it . 
treat william , look like rhett butler but sound like mickey mous , is one of the worst villain i have ever seen in a movi . 
onli catherin zeta jone , as one of william cohort turn in a good perform . 
she ha energi and spunk , which the movi need much more of . 
oh yeah , the phantom also ha a secret ident but thi is so poorli play out you wo n't even care . 
about the onli thing i can recommend are a good perform by jone , and some color sceneri . 
howev , if your look for a fun famili movi , go watch the underr flipper . 
thi is not a good movi .
