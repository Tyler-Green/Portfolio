`` knock off `` is exactli that : a cheap knock off of an action movi . 
it 's also the worst movi i have seen thu far thi year . 
i figur it would be at least a coupl of month befor i saw the worst film of 1998 , but ala , it ha alreadi been found . 
jean-claud van damm star as ( i think ) a design jean execut who discov hi half-broth ha been suppli him with cheaper good . 
rob schneider play van damm 's partner , and rochon play . . . 
actual , i have no idea who rochon wa suppos to be . 
she just sort of pop up halfway through without an explan as to whi she wa there . 
mani thing are not explain in thi film , but i do know that for some bizarr reason , van damm seem to be do a jacki chan impress throughout the flick . 
where chan come off as endear in hi `` normal guy `` charact seen in mani of hi film , van damm just come off as a wimp . 
we 're never given ani clear explan as to the basi for mani of hi action . 
to be more clear : i did not even know who he wa suppos to be until about an hour into the movi , and even then , it wa not made too clear . 
the film ha been direct in the style of some strang film experi gone horribl wrong . 
tsui hark ( who direct van damm 's last movi , the bad , but not nearli as bad as thi , `` doubl team `` ) never let the camera rest for a second , and that 's no exagger . 
we are even treat to a five second shot from the point of view of van damm 's foot enter a shoe . 
fabul ! 
serious , though , i have no problem with director who want to play around with film convent , as long as they do n't get carri away . 
for exampl , look at sam raimi . 
`` armi of dark `` , one of hi best movi , featur some of the most invent camera work i have ever seen , but raimi never let the special effect get in the way of stori . 
that 's a concept that tsui ca n't seem to grasp . 
the special effect and outrag camera angl * rule * `` knock off `` to the point where the audienc doe n't have a clue as to what 's happen ani more . 
anoth problem with the film is that it look cheap . 
the film stock use is of such low calib that i thought i wa watch one of those chines film shown realli late at night . 
and for some inexplic reason , everyon 's voic seem to have been dub . 
even the star . 
and even the special effect , seemingli the onli aspect of the film the director actual care about , are inconsist . 
for exampl , there is a scene in which van damm drive a car out of a window . 
the car slam into the ground , and the left wheel is complet destroy . 
second later , the car drive off at full speed . 
hey , i have no problem suspend my disbelief in an action movi , but a line must be drawn somewher . 
final , the act . 
nobodi give a good perform in thi film . 
van damm , an actor i usual like , is way off the mark play `` everyman `` . 
and schneider , here to provid comic relief i assum , is total unfunni and over act hi way through everi scene . 
even the usual solid paul sorvino give a terribl over-the-top perform as . . . 
onc again , i have no idea who he wa suppos to be . 
in case i have n't yet made it clear enough , `` knock off `` is the worst movi of van damm 's career and possibl the worst movi of the decad . 
and it 's not even one of those movi that 's so bad it 's funni . 
it 's too inept to be funni . 
there are no redeem factor in `` knock off `` and i serious hope that everi print of thi film is burn to a crisp and that somehow my memori of watch the film can be eras .
