a movi like mortal kombat : annihil work ( and must be review on ) multipl level . 
first , there 's the rampant usag of randian subtext that pervad the entir movi . 
but occasionali , almost as if make an iron , self-depreci remark , the movi toss in clearli marxist imageri . 
no no . . . 
just kid . 
had you go there for a moment , did n't i ? 
in all serious howev , and to be fair to the movi , it * is * necessari to provid two viewpoint : that of a movi watcher unfamiliar ( or onli margin familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movi and/or a fan of the game . 
the first movi ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concern itself with a martial art tournament that would decid the fate of earth ( and it 's 5 billion inhabit ) . 
the mortal won , and in theori thi should have prevent the emperor shao khan from take over the earth . 
unfortun , shao khan wa a poor loser , and the veri final scene in mortal kombat show him arriv anyway , readi to take over the planet , as our hero assum a fight stanc . 
the first movi wa extraordinarili entertain for those ( like myself ) who are fan of the game . 
i 'd even go so far as to say that mani folk who did n't know about the game probabl enjoy the movi . 
the writer and director knew the limit of both their cast and of the basic stori itself , and they did n't tri to overachiev . 
there were a lot of realli cool fight scene ( with realli cool accompani music ) , intersperes with some distract ( but ultim non-intrus ) bit of fluff pass itself off as a plot . 
and , as we know , the movi wa a smash success at the box offic . 
mortal kombat : annihil pick up precis where that movi left off , with some introductori exposit to clue in those who may not have seen the first movi . 
shao khan ha decid that he 's go to take over the earth * anyway * , and to hell with some silli rule about mortal win the tournament . 
thereaft follow approxim 85 minut of film that altern between be confus , be trite , be silli , and be just plain stupid . 
one get the gener impress that the produc of the movi thought `` hey , that last movi wa such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movi now . `` 
too bad they did n't simpli stick with the formula from the first movi . 
i could write volum about the thing that are wrong with thi pictur , but here are the high point : 
* the act is truli bad . 
sandra hess ( play the sonya blade charact ) is particularli execr , especi in scene where she tri to convinc us that she love johnni cage ( a charact from the first movi who get greas at the begin of thi movi ) . 
* in one of the worst piec of mis-cast i think i 've * ever * seen , jame remar play raiden , the god of thunder . 
in the first movi , christoph lambert play raiden and play hi charact as though he wa in on the joke : a french actor play a japanes thunder god be rever by chines mystic . 
i gener like it when actor are cast against type ( tim `` tini `` lister , jr . be cast as the presid of the u . s . in the fifth element , for exampl ) , and remar ha alway been one of my favorit `` util `` actor but he 's so total wrong for thi part that he doe n't even have the luxuri of amus self-awar . 
* there are too mani charact that are introduc as be potenti import , but then never seen again . 
* there are a number of complet meaningless stori sidetrack , includ a muddl scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seek out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , ha a mystic hallucin , and then wander off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . 
for these reason ( and mani other ) , i can onli give the movi a 2 . . . 
. . . unless you 're a huge fan of the game and/or the first movi . 
in that case , the follow critiqu also appli : 
* sandra hess , while be an even wors actress than bridgett wilson ( who play sonya blade in the first movi ) , is much more convinc as a fighter . 
wilson look like she wa simpli mimic some movement taught to her by the fight choreograph . 
hess look like she actual know some martial art , and put togeth a much more believ fight scene . 
* in the fight , each of the charact doe at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . 
sonya doe her `` kiss of death , `` jax doe hi `` earthquak , `` liu kang doe hi `` anim , `` and so on . 
a big bonu for those of us who were look for similar move in the first movi and found them onli rare . 
* there are n't as mani fight scene in thi movi as there were in the first , becaus the folk make the movi mistakenli tri to hang a more robust plot in between . 
silli , silli folk . 
and the lamest fight involv two of the women in what turn into a mud-wrestl match . 
lame and so obvious sexist even i ( polit incorrect , for the most part ) notic and remark upon it . 
* the special effect are gener better , except for the final fight scene between the empor and liu kang in which both perform their `` anim . `` 
motaro and sheeva are both more convinc and lifelik than goro wa in the first movi . 
for folk like myself who love the first movi and enjoy the game , i give thi a 5 . 
you 'll probabl like it , but not nearli as much as you like the first one .
