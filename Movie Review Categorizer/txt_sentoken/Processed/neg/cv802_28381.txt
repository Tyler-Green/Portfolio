if you 've been follow william fichtner 's career ( and there 's absolut no reason whi you should have ) , you might have notic that he 's play some rather similar role over the year . 
like sulli in `` the perfect storm `` -- tough , gruff , and a littl bit scari . 
or law in `` albino allig `` -- tough , gruff , and littl bit scarier . 
or colonel william sharp in `` armageddon , `` or dwayn engelman in `` strang day , `` or even hi brief appear toward the begin of `` pearl harbor , `` as the abus father of danni -- here is an actor who gravit toward tough , gruff , hard-hit role . 
which is whi hi perform in `` what 's the worst that could happen ? `` 
is such a shock , such a delight . 
in the film , fichtner play a blond hair , meticul dress , overtli effemin , dog-lov detect . 
as alex tardio , fichtner 's perform border on caricatur but goe beyond it . 
it border on offens but doe n't realli manag it . 
and it border on clich ? d stereotyp but doe n't quit succumb to that definit either . 
in a role so diametr oppos to what the actor ha play befor we should have seen it come , fichtner is n't perfect -- you can see him struggl a littl at time , concentr a littl too hard on the look as he swish hi hand through the air , or nuzzl a coif canin up close and person -- but he 's pretti damn good , and silli , and without question the best thing in the film . 
in fact , had it not been for fitchner 's sudden and bizarr appear , and hi jar screen presenc thereaft , i would have walk out , for `` what 's the worst that could happen ? `` 
is mesmer in it aw , a poorli written , haphazardli edit , and total unfunni ( ye , it star martin lawrenc and danni devito so how could that be possibl ? ) 
moviego experi . 
fichtner 's perform doe n't exactli save the film , and it 's not like i 'm recommend `` what 's the worst that could happen ? `` 
sole on the strength of the actor 's dramat turnaround , but hi contribut do rais the film 's rate from no star to one-and-a-half . 
thumb up to fichtner then , and thumb down -- way , way , down -- to everyon els involv in thi sorri mess , a movi so dull and pedestrian and nonsens it doe n't even warrant discuss .
