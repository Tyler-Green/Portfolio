the premis of thi movi is , well , pretti far-fetch . 
tom bereng play shale , a mercenari who is temporarili out of work ( those fool at the cia have deni hi exist just becaus he and hi buddi botch a job in cuba ) . 
fortun , hi girl friend ( dian venora ) , a teacher at christoph columbu high school in miami , get her knee cap broken by a disgruntl student , creat a job open for shale as a substitut teacher . 
not tell hi girl friend , who might object on pedagog ground , he creat a number of fake higher degre for himself ( from yale , harvard , princeton , et al ) and begin hi tenur as a high school teacher . 
the student ( junki , drug dealer , gang member , sleazi slut , ice-pick wielder . . . you 
get the pictur ) do n't realli take to him right away , so he hit one in the face with a can and break a few finger . 
thi get their attent to a certain extent , so he tell them the stori of the vietnam war : `` see , some homeboy from the north tri to muscl in on the turf of the homeboy from the south . `` 
oh yeah , now they can dig it ; the problem is just that nobodi ever explain it properli befor . 
but wait ! 
there are drug be dealt in the school itself ! 
and behind the whole scheme , in cahoot with the head gang , the kod ( no , not `` cod `` , but `` knight of destruct `` . . . realli ! ) , is none other than . . . the 
upright , ex-cop princip , play by the forgotten ghostbust , erni hudson ! 
so shale doe what ani good teacher would do . 
he get hi buddi togeth , they gather togeth a bunch of bazooka and other major weapon , explos , and cool stuff like that , and they have a big showdown against the drug dealer and kod at the high school . 
ok , so the premis is not just far-fetch , it 's downright dumb . 
if thi were a hong kong action comedi , we might just accept it , but it take itself far too serious to be truli fun . 
oh , it ha it moment ; how one can truli hate a movi in which huge ( realli huge ) amount of cocain are deliv in school buss ? 
and to be fair , it is almost never realli bore , as the action is interrupt by onli short sequenc of actual stori . 
but over all , thi is pretti much a made-for-tv movi with more ( and bigger ) explos and more foul languag . 
in fact , it remind me of `` miami vice `` without the product valu , babe in skimpi bikini , and pastel . 
if you can sneak into the theater without pay , go for it . 
otherwis , wait for video . 
the fli inkpot rate system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . 
* * a littl creaki , but still better than stay at home with gotcha ! 
* * * pretti good , bring a friend . 
* * * * amaz , potent stuff . 
* * * * * perfect . 
see it twice .
