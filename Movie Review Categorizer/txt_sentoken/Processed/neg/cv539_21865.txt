well arnold ha complet the seemingli imposs task . 
he ha made three consecut unsatisfactori action film . 
in a domain that he own , it is veri surpris that thi goliath of an action star can not tell a good action script from a bad one . 
eras , back in 1996 , wa a confus film that made no attempt at all to make sens . 
batman and robin , in 1997 , wa the black sheep of the batman seri with ridicul act , idiot action scene , and pain flashi costum . 
now in 1999 , `` end of day `` ( not `` the end of day `` ) is the third strike in a tough at bat for arnold . 
is thi the end of a power action star 's long-liv career ? 
will arnold ever give us anoth unforgett perform in anoth unforgett classic like those in the past ( `` termin `` , `` termin 2 : judgement day `` , `` predat `` ) ? 
or an unforgett perform in a great guilti pleasur like those in the past ( `` commando `` , `` red sonja `` , `` true lie `` ) ? 
it doe n't look that way . 
`` end of day `` begin with the birth of a babi girl in 1979 who inexor , due to the format of the star on that night , will be the carrier of satan 's babi the hour befor new year 's of 2000 . 
fortun for the movi 's sake , the girl grow up and now resid in manhattan with skyscrap , subway train in dark tunnel , and a myriad of inept nypd offic . 
it 's an action film 's dream come true when the director is given ton of cool stuff to blow up . 
imagin if the girl had live in anytown , usa , where the onli thing to destroy is a dairi queen and a post offic . 
arnold schwarzenegg ( jericho cane ) , in a seri of bore event find himself in the middl of a religi battl between the church , who is tri to hide the girl ( or in some case tri to kill her ) , and satan ( gabriel byrn ) who is tri to make her pregnant . 
if the devil is success , the world will no longer exist as we know it . 
jericho feel it is hi duti to protect the girl from everyon becaus 1 ) he onc had faith but no longer doe and 2 ) hi wife and daughter were kill and he feel respons for it . 
jericho cane is your clich , by-the-numb hero right up to hi name . 
arnold fittingli play the charact as clich as he can . 
he shout at everyon , from cop to priest , to the devil . 
in one truli hilari scene , which wa suppos to be the ultim dramat high point , jericho scream to the devil ; `` you are a @ # $ ^ % ! & 
choir boy ! 
you are a choir boy ! `` 
those two line mark the high point of thi film . 
a movi can still be enjoy when the support cast is more effect than the main actor . 
`` end of day `` fail to contain ani memor perform with the except of gabriel byrn . 
byrn , play a man who ha been made the manifest of the devil , seem to be the onli one who is have fun in thi whole movi . 
he wonder play a manipul villain with the power to control everyon at ani time . 
the annoy thing about hi charact , howev , is that he ha the power to kill ani human with a simpl punch in the face , yet he find it imposs to serious hurt jericho . 
i can not count the number of time he could have kill jericho and taken the girl from hi custodi . 
the other actor in the film give veri weak and unconvinc perform . 
kevin pollak , who play the partner and close friend of jericho , is the supposedli funni charact in the film ( everi action movi ha one ) . 
the one problem is that pollak doe not deliv one funni line . 
robin tunney play the chosen mother of satan 's babi with extrem annoy . 
she get no sympathi from ani of the charact in the film , except arnold who pretend she is hi wife and daughter , or ani of the viewer in the audienc . 
in one unnecessari scene , tunney walk out of her room and take her top off . 
is thi her job in the film ? 
the actor are not to blame entir becaus the script is terribl . 
you can tell a script is terribl when you are abl to predict what will happen minut befor it doe . 
thi littl predict game is a veri fun except to tri to sit through thi nonsens of a movi . 
in a last attempt to make thi movi good , special effect are use to tri to entertain the audienc . 
but without a memor action scene in the whole film , the director ha not done hi job success . 
thi film would have gotten a c+ if arnold stood in front of a camera and shout `` you are a ! $ @ ^ @ * ^ 
choir boy ! ! `` 
for two hour .
