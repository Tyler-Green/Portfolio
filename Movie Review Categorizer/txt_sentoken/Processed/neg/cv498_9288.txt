i think we should , as respons citizen , all get togeth and stop jim carrey from make anoth movi . 
he 's chang the cinema as we know it -- and for the worst . 
i would willingli rewatch batman and robin rather then again sit through thi miser collect of filmic moment -- prologu , epilogu , etc . the premis : a lawyer ca n't lie for a day . 
ho , ho . 
normal a movi made from thi premis would be terribl -- mr . 
carrey suce in make it unwatch . 
i laugh onc -- and i wa laugh at the sight of everyon els laugh . 
grind doe n't begin to describ . 
it pound on your head so forc and so unstopp that , if you are a normal person , you leav feel sick . 
when it 's not tri to be funni , it 's tri to be melodramat -- but it 's just annoy , stupid and sappi . 
at best . 
thi movi is intend to make peopl laugh , ye , not to be vote best pictur of all time by sight and sound . 
but , it fail on everi possibl level . 
it fail to be funni . 
it fail to be insight . 
it fail to be suspens . 
it fail to be fun . 
they should pay peopl to see it . 
it suce on one level -- it make me want to get down on the ground and start thank orson well , for have live . 
if you go in with the intent of come out aliv , pleas make sure that you are overli fond of boob , fart , pimpl and fat joke -- otherwis you will go insan . 
ye , liter insan . 
stark , rave mad . 
it is bore , stupid , melodramat and in the end ugli . 
i reccemond it strongli . 
to ed wood .
