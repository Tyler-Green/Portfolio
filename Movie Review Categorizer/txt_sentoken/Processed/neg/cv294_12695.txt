in thi re-mak of the 1954 japanes monster film , godzilla is transform into a `` jurass park `` copi who swim from the south pacif to new york for no real reason and trash the town . 
although some of the destruct is entertain for a while , it get old fast . 
the film often make no sens ( a several-hundr foot tall beast hide in subway tunnel ) , sport second-r effect ( the babi godzilla seem to be one comput effect multipli on the screen ) , lame joke ( mayor ebert and hi assist gene are never funni ) , horrend act ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an unbeliev love stori ( whi would anyon want to get back togeth with maria pitillo 's charact ? ) . 
there are other element of the film that fall flat , but go on would just be a wast of good word . 
onli for die-hard creatur featur fan , thi might be fun if you could check your brain at the door . 
i could n't . 
( michael redman ha written thi column for 23 year and ha seldom had a more disori cinemat experi than see both `` fear and loath `` and `` godzilla `` in the same even . )
