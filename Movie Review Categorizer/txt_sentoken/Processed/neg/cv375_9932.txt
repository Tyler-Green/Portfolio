you would think that thi film 's dismal failur would be due to american filmmak get hold of a brilliant british comedi and `` american `` it . 
you 'd be wrong , sinc full blame can be place on the veri folk who wrote and creat the seri : rowan atkinson , robin driscol , and richard curti . 
should you ever happen to meet those chap , do me a favor . 
grab them by the hair and yell realli loudli in their ear , `` what were you think ? ! 
have you ever heard the phrase 'if it ai n't broke do n't fix it ' ? ! `` 
then walk away . 
the film concern mr . bean ( atkinson ) and hi visit to america while escort the paint of `` whistler 's mother `` to an american buyer ( play by burt reynold , in the type of bit part that hi success in `` boogi night `` should hope do away with ) . 
now how or whi mr . bean is sent on thi trip make no sens , and i ca n't even describ how the film explain it . 
the point is that mr . bean come to america and caus wacki troubl . 
problem problem problem , where to begin ? 
first , the score music from the tv show ha been complet replac by score that is either at time one note away from the score from `` beetlejuic `` or one note away from the score from `` rob roy `` . 
then , the song choic are total uninspir . 
`` good vibrat `` ? 
`` i love l . a . `` ? 
wow , do n't put ani thought into that guy . 
also , bean make way too much nois in the film . 
the charact doe n't speak much , but in the seri you realli onli heard the laughter of the audienc , and mayb the occasion murmur from mr . bean . 
each episod wa like a chaplin silent movi . 
in the film , bean is constantli moan , grunt , whine , etc . it 's annoy , and just plain wrong for the charact . 
the main problem though is that it 's just not funni . 
with each episod of the seri there would be dozen of realli great laugh cram into less than 30 minut . 
multipli that run time by three howev , and the laugh steadili decreas . 
they even have the gaul to repeat joke from the seri . 
sad , and creativ lazi . 
as a seri , `` mr . bean `` onli ran for about 13 episod or so . 
whi on earth did atkinson and the gang decid it wa time to complet rework everyth ? 
13 half-hour episod certainli had n't exhaust all possibl situat . 
all i can say posit for the film at thi point is that it 's almost appropri for all age , if it wa n't for a coupl of scene where it appear as though mr . bean is have sex with thing . 
and even that is n't a veri posit statement . 
pleas guy , go back to england and go back to televis so you 'll make me laugh again .
