thi season need anoth serial killer movi like kathi lee gifford need more public devast . 
but lo and behold , here come `` switchback , `` and fast on the heel of such stalker fare as `` kiss the girl `` and `` i know what you did last summer . `` 
but `` switchback `` is an undoubtedli weak genr entri , as the materi it cover is old and tire , and the filmmak rare sustain enough energi to make ani of the proceed interest . 
`` switchback `` open with the murder of a babysitt and the abduct of the young child she 's watch . 
we learn late in the game that the kid belong to fbi agent frank lacross ( denni quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/kil is a nameless fiend that lacross ha been track across the countri for quit a while . 
he is promptli remov from the case , but thi conflict of interest doe n't keep him from offer pursuit . 
lacross 's most recent trek take him to a blood-soak hotel room in amarillo , texa , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between hi re-elect campaign and help hi new alli catch hi man . 
in a relat asid , former railway worker bob goodal ( danni glover ) is cruis through the snowbound west in hi pinup-plast ( even on the seatbelt ) el dorado . 
along the way , he pick up -- and subsequ save the life of -- hitchhik loner lane dixon ( jare leto ) . 
thi tangent is n't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either hold a piec of the puzzl or turn out to be the killer himself . 
or is the villain in fact lacross , onli pretend to be after the cold-heart murder he know so much about . 
in a sens , that 's half of the basic problem with `` switchback . `` 
for it first hour , the movi present evid that ani of these three men could be the perpetr , so we 're given littl insight into who they are , like for fear that we 'll learn too much too fast and therefor be abl to make the proper deduct . 
but `` switchback `` then decid to explicitli reveal the killer 's ident at it midpoint , and the follow contradictori charact motiv muddl both the pace and the gener of suspens . 
some of the act is a burdensom area as well , probabl becaus the perform were instruct to build persona that are the exact opposit of their true selv . 
what is danni glover do here , grin and yeehaw hi way through the messi plot ? 
and denni quaid ? 
( that monoton -- stop it ! ) 
ermey is solid in a support role that 's more interest than the two lead thrown togeth , but the charismat leto ( clair dane ' object of affect in `` my so-cal life `` ) is a scene-steal tri and true . 
> from a materi standpoint , `` switchback `` is pretti empti . 
but even when first-tim director jeb stuart ( who wrote `` the fugit `` and `` die hard `` ) doe n't know what to do , he know what he want it to look like -- the movi provid some great visual . 
the set-on-a-train climax look good ( even though the action is illog ) , and the beauti , crisp cinematographi captur the rocki in all of their ici splendor . 
still , that 's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movi 's look will end up leav you cold .
