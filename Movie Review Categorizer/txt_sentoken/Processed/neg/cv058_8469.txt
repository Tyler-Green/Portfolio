of cours i knew thi go in . 
whi is it that whenev a tv-star make a movi it 's alway a romant comedi , and then they say on entertain tonight or someth , that they were `` attract to the charact . 
they were realli origin . `` 
origin ? ! let me give you a run-through of pictur perfect : charact a ) kate ( jennif aniston , from tv 's friend ) , a smart , beauti , profession woman want two thing she ca n't have : a new job-titl and the love of her co-work kevin bacon . 
her boss will onli give her the job if she get marri and get a mortgag and get a leas on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnli sleep with marri or involv girl . 
what doe she do ? 
she invent a fianc ! 
then when everyon want to meet him , she tell some poor schmoe she met at a wed that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a compani dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thu break the engag but still be abl to keep her job , sinc the guy end up look like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless femal . 
he , of cours , goe along with it . 
gee , i wonder if they get togeth in the end . 
i 've seen more origin stuff on the wb . 
and better stuff too . 
pictur perfect also make the mistak of be _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minut , and expect us to like aniston 's charact , who come off as a cold , spoil bitch .
