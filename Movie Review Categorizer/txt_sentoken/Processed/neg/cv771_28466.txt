plot : lara croft is british , rich and kick a lot of ass . 
she also like to raid tomb but when the illuminata discov that all nine planet are about to stand in align for the first time in 5000 year , and that lara hold the key to time , well , needless to say , they want to nab it from her . 
oh yeah , lara also like to sport a lot of tight shirt . . . hummana-hummana-hummana . . . 
critiqu : angelina joli wa great in thi movi . 
there were also about three `` action scene `` that were pretti cool to look at in thi film . 
uhhhhhm , unfortun the rest of the movi suck ! 
bad dialogu , gener sidekick and bad guy , a lame mysteri , yoda-esqu moment with mumbo-jumbo be sprout about and even some crappi cgi near the end . 
all in all , thi movi wa n't the horror show that some of the earli review had warn us about , especi sinc everi other scene doe featur joli 's torpedo beg to burst out of her lucki shirt , but it wa quit the letdown nonetheless , especi when you consid the major opportun that the filmmak had here to creat a cool , hip woman hero , base on a popular video game . 
i do n't know , i guess you have to put most of the blame on director simon west , who did n't realli tie the whole movi togeth all that well . 
the film lack energi , a consist pace and well . . . a 
fun time ! 
i felt kinda depress while watch thi movi . 
all that `` father `` crap wa horribl and the dialogu given to poor john voight to recit wa just plain embarrass ( and i 'm not even gon na mention hi moustach . . . heheh ) . 
whi have thi shite in the movi at all ? ! ? 
i especi hate the scene in which some ghost-lik figur , friend or child would rambl on about lara croft 's father while all the time , i 'm not give one ounc of crap as to what they 're talk about . 
i guess that 's call lack of `` charact develop `` , right ? 
that 's when a movi build enough background into the charact on the screen , so that we could actual `` get into `` it and care about them . 
i did n't care about anyon in thi movi , and wa bore dure most of it `` let 's explain whi we 're do all thi gobbledygook `` moment . 
and even though i thought that joli kick some mighti ass ( damn , did she look sexi blast those gun or what ? ! ? ) , everybodi els around her wa so goddamn bore ! 
her butler wa a throwaway with no person , her side-kick wa suppos to be funni but just annoy me everi time he said the word `` bugger `` ( and he say it a lot , trust me ! ) and all of the so-cal bad guy just spew one-dimens ! 
they had no spark , no energi amongst them , and even though a few of the action scene in the movi were cool ( see the trailer and you 'll know which one i 'm talk about ) , the overal pictur wa lame and the dialogu and mystic bull-crap just buri it even further . 
also , for a movi that 's suppos to be about all of these exot locat , i wa n't necessarili impress by ani of it exterior shot , and even less so with it interior , which all look like they were shot in the same room . 
mind you , i wo n't go as far as to say that it 's the `` worst movi of the year `` ( rememb that i actual have to go see freddi prinz jr . movi also ! ) , but it 's definit the worst film that i 've seen dure thi summer movi season ( of cours , it 's still earli and i 'm sure there are a few more garbag heap come down the pike ) . 
skip thi one altogeth and rent ani of the indiana jone movi instead . . . trust 
me , you 'll miss the boob but end your night with some rock-solid porn and it 's all good !
