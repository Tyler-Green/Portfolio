`` payback , `` brian helgeland 's inauspici direct debut ( coincident , he previous pen the award-win screenplay for 1997 's `` l . a . confidenti `` ) , is a wildli uneven and thoroughli unpleas reveng thriller that take one idea -- -a movi with non-stop violenc , death , and villain -- -and run with it , or should i say , bare manag to crawl away with it . 
mel gibson , in yet anoth disappoint pictur ( `` conspiraci theori `` and `` lethal weapon 4 , `` anyon ? ) , star as the reprehens villain/hero , porter , a man who becom determin to get hi 50 % share of $ 140 , 000 , which he stole in a robberi , back when hi partner-in-crim ( gregg henri ) and drug-addict wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leav him for dead . 
porter is not dead , howev -- -not by a long shot -- -a he quickli rehabilit and , along with hi loyal prositut girlfriend , rosi ( maria bello ) , set out to make everyon involv in the scam pay . 
the taglin for `` payback `` is , `` get readi to root for the bad guy , `` and sure enough , thi is true , as pretti much everi signific charact who appear is crook in some way . 
i would n't have a problem with thi offbeat detail if the pain thin stori had been of ani interest , but it wa n't , and therefor , i found myself have an especi labori time invest myself into a wide array of charact that have absolut no redeem qualiti whatsoev . 
no attempt is made to flesh the role into three-dimension charact , and there are no vacant sign that anyon ha ani sort of human in them . 
just becaus the protagonist , a `` bad guy , `` is play by mel gibson doe n't mean i will `` root for him , `` and i did n't . 
quit the contrari , everi person in the movi deserv to die a gori death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceed ) . 
sinc none of the respect actor in `` payback `` actual have human be to play , onli one perform manag to stand out . 
luci alexi liu ( of t . v . 's `` alli mcbeal `` ) , who play a spici s & m dominatrix , brighten up everi scene she is in , and ha a definit flair for comedi , someth i would have like to have seen more of , sinc most of the humor fell with a resound splat . 
meanwhil , gibson , who is perfectli fine here , sleepwalk through a role that is not the least bit challeng . 
unger , who made an impress in 1997 's `` the game , `` is surprisingli wast and it is difficult to see whi she took such a part sinc she disappear ten minut in , and onli ha two purpros : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) becaus she play a key part in an earli flashback . 
final , kri kristofferson appear in a throwaway role dure the climax , and thi unnecessari plot develop stick out like a sore thumb ( tellingli , he did n't appear in the origin cut of the film , but wa cast when extens reshoot took place month later ) . 
like most action movi , the star often take a lick but keep on tick . 
in the cours of the 102-minut run time of `` payback , `` porter is shot three time in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and ha hi feet smash with a sledgehamm . 
and guess what ? 
not onli doe he surviv the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucki in the penultim sequenc ( and can still walk ! ) , 
even though he look like he had recent substitut for a punch bag . 
`` payback `` is not , in ani way , an entertain film , even though i am sure the maker hope it would be with all the graphic carnag that goe on , but take away that violenc and what you are basic left with is a blank screen . 
perhap director helgeland would have been smart to consid thi , so he could have at least ad a few worthwhil element , like a fresh storylin and charact whom you could even remot stand to be around for a few hour .
