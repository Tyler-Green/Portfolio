the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfr ( the ubergod , michael gough ) say , `` i think we need a bigger bat cave , `` or someth to that note . 
that 's exactli what thi film is - too big for it own good becaus it ha too damn much . 
cut batgirl out . 
cut one of the villain . 
it 's too much to handl in one dosag . 
it 's so much that charact get left behind . 
poor ell get a mere 3 scene and a subplot which is introduc but never finish in ani way , shape or form . 
and ell deserv better . 
thi is the fourth in the gigant film seri and the second from director joel schumach . 
it 's also the fourth worst in the seri ( and second worst from joel ) . 
the seri ha been declin sinc it stun debut , follow by the almost-as-stun sequel and then the anti-climact third one ( first by joel ) . 
thi one 's not anti-climact - i knew it wa gon na suck . 
it 's up to joel to make it fun though . 
`` batman forev `` wa fun . 
thi is a big bore of over-produc action sequenc and shallow charact . 
i mean , thi one bit . 
i 'm gon na put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freez ( ah-nold ) , who 's wife wa die of some diseas , ha becom the new big villain these day . 
he 's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ? 
joker ? ) and now ha a bodi temperatur of a big fat zero and ha a blue bodi . 
batman ( georg ) and robin ( chri ) fight him a bit but find they 're grow apart . 
meanwhil , anoth villain show up , poison ivi ( uma ! ) , who wa a dorki scientist chick work on flower in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kill her when she find out he 's use her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basic a man pump with chemic which probabl kill ani person he ever had . 
she emerg from her chemic ( do n't ask 'caus i ca n't tell ya ) as a sexi woman ( the real uma ) who 's poison when or if you kiss her and ha some aphrodiasiat scent she blow at peopl . 
she start to tear away at the dynam duo . 
meanwhil , alfr 's die of the same diseas mr . freez 's wife ha ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and hi niec , barbara ( alicia ) , come all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not realli soon , it take her 2 hour ) becom batgirl . 
meanwhil , in an unfinish subplot , bruce ( batman 's alter-ego , if you forgot ) ha been date the love juli madison ( the even lovlier ell macpherson ) who want a commit after a year but he say noth . 
end of her for all we know . 
mr . freez ultim team with poison ivi and they want to freez the world and then take it over grow new plant as their popul ( do n't ask ! ! ! ) . 
the trio must team togeth `` as famili `` to beat them . 
there ya go . 
not the whole stori but no big context clue . 
too much , right ? 
right ! 
the film seem patch togeth of nice littl idea which would have made for a coupl good sequel . 
howev , while tim burton nice balanc the villain/batman storylin ( although not wonder ) , joel seem to do almost noth with batman in thi one . 
he get some corni speech , a coupl clever line and that 's it . 
mayb some stunt . 
for all thi , i ca n't even comment on georg clooney as batman - i hardli saw the guy ! 
and when i did , he had horribl dialogu to say . 
i think michael keaton is the quintessenti batman but val kilmer wa too robot and fake as batman in the last episod . 
georg is in between them . 
he 's not quintessenti , he 's not horribl , he 's good . 
but i 'm sure next time when they decid to renov the seri sinc they 'll be critic murder for thi sorri effort , we 'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still ha the job ) . 
the villain are the onli interest part of the seri accord to schumach . 
last time , we had the brawn of two face as play by tommi lee jone and the brains/comedi suppli by the riddler as realiz by jim carrey . 
thi time we have a somewhat sympathet and somewhat hatabl villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freez . 
we feel bad for hi mental/phys collaps but doe he realli need to kill everyon for plant ? 
arnold is n't veri good - too hokey but kinda sympathet at some point . 
when he watch old movi of hi wife , he actual look somber . 
wow . 
but uma make the most of her seduct charact , get the right point between hammi and seduct . 
it 's like she 's almost parodi herself in `` pulp fiction `` at point . 
she 's incred hot and make the movi pretti much a star better . 
as for the lower bat-peopl , chri is the same as he wa in `` batman forev , `` although i think hi work in these is too hokey when he 's best at quieter part in `` scent of a woman `` or just plain cool part in `` fri green tomoto . `` 
alicia - i love the girl but she 's not particularli good in thi film . 
she can hypotheit act , we all saw that in `` clueless , `` but her line kinda sound weird . 
and it is n't the mushy-mouth thi time . 
but in all fair , she ha virtual no part . 
joel get around to her occasion and when she 's on , she doe stupid stuff . . . although 
i know i 'm not the onli one who love the catfight between her and uma . . . 
and poor ell . 
poor , poor ell . 
i love that woman and she can also hypothet act ( for those of us who saw `` siren `` ) . 
but she ha no part ! ! ! 
it seem like joel had so much footag that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . 
there are no `` couch `` scene ( like my best friend notic ) . 
now listen to me on thi one - in everi `` batman `` flick , there 's a couch scene . 
in the origin , it wa with vicki . 
in `` return , `` it wa a good make-out scene with selena . 
and in the last one , it wa a chat with nicol . 
thi one , it 's noth . 
and batgirl doe next-to-noth in thi film till the end when she 's suddenli `` part of the famili . `` 
fortun , we get a lot of alfr . 
he 's the alway reliabl butler , in case you did n't know , who ha been with bruce all hi life . 
he 's a god . 
he 's a father figur . 
he 's also die . 
thi got to me . 
i love alfr almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in hi tux , and freak die just get to me . 
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappi the whole time . . . but 
thi is never answer , as thi film is too clutter . 
but in defens , it doe have some good part , other than uma . 
for one , georg is a good batman but unfortun get noth to do . 
and there are some nice touch . 
when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient 's belong in a room and we see the riddler 's costum . 
i laugh . 
and dure a biker scene ( involv robin and batgirl - anoth subplot never handl past initi period ) , we not onli see coolio but a bunch of bad-ass dress as `` droog `` from `` a clockwork orang . `` 
i laugh at all these . 
the film fall apart around the five-minut mark dure an enorm long action sequenc which must last around 20 minut . . . or 
did it just feel like that ? 
the film should serv as anoth in the long-lin of film which demonstr that we need more intellig film nowaday . 
peopl are fed up with stupid film . 
that 's whi the word of mouth kill `` the lost world ! `` 
that 's whi last year , indi film gross more than ever . 
that 's whi thi will have a strong box-offic init from peopl who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevin kill it . 
that 's whi the next two big-budget aciton pic are john woo 's `` face/off `` and barri sonnenfeld 's `` men in black , `` both which are the first two to catch on to the wave earli on . 
i like joel schumach more as a person than an artist . 
i like some of hi film ( `` flatlin , `` `` a time to kill `` ) but a lot of them suck . 
he 's a realli eccentr person and i love one of hi quot about how he admit to be a mediocr director and that 's what make him great . 
but hi costum for woodi allen 's `` sleeper `` wa more interest than thi one ( and hi costum wa cool - look for the nazi number ) . 
i love the `` batman `` seri . 
the first two rock and i did like the last one . 
but thi one is not go to be one that i watch repeatedli like the other three . 
hope , thi will also serv as a springboard to a better batman next time . 
and mayb they 'll get smart and bring back catwoman . 
and michael keaton . 
but we can onli hope .
