the origin _babe_ wa my favorit movi of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcend it target audienc . 
be a surpris commerci and critic success , it had no market tie-in , which limit it final take . 
thu , babe 2 arriv , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 . 
plush doll , vend machin hawk t-shirt , and maci 's thanksgiv day balloon arriv for holiday money-grub . 
too late . 
thi is a sad review to write , becaus babe 2 not onli doe _not_ live up to the origin , but it doe n't even come to a fraction of it . 
i should n't expect that sequel to modern fairi tale to match their predecessor ' magic , but thi film tri too hard , and lose it charm . 
consid a driver appli the acceler with great intens , unawar that hi car is in neutral . 
imagin with me , if you will , _scream_ 's jami kennedi , explain the `` rule `` for sequel like babe 2 . 
( 1 ) there must be _more_ talk anim . 
( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedi . 
( 3 ) there must be _more_ song for those mice to sing : that 's cute . 
( 4 ) keep the stori card to break up the action : that 's cute too , even though `` the pig get wise `` made no sens , given the context of that stori partit . 
( 5 ) there must be action , howev illog , that will conjur up pivot scene from the origin : the trademark song that nobodi rememb the word to , the baa-ram-ew secret code , the `` that 'll do , pig . 
that 'll do . `` 
now throw in the limit : ( a ) jame cromwel , now a hot commod , ha limit time on the set ( or mayb he did n't approv of the script ) . 
( b ) christin cavanaugh , the voic of the origin babe , demand more money ( $ 200 , 000 -- paltri consid the $ 80 million budget ) . 
out . 
e . g . 
daili come in with notic result . 
( c ) georg miller , the director , is more well-known for hi dark futurist mad max film and hi twilight zone segment , not for kiddi fare ( and no , he did n't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) . 
( d ) the special effect are impress , _but limited_ . 
babe talk , but most of the time from a singl shot , repeat over and over again . 
( babe is center screen , look straight into the camera , with a happi smirk -- regardless of whether he 's happi , or scare , or tire ) . 
season now with the `` origin `` element , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hel bin . 
( i ) chang the venu into `` the big citi `` . 
thi ha been prais as wildli origin . 
excus me : did n't _home alone_ do thi sever year ago ? 
how about the muppet ? 
even _the bad news bears_ travel to tokyo . 
sorri . 
no dice . 
side note : to give the citi a fairy-tal look , georg miller craft a fantast fantasyland that merg the landmark of the world 's great citi , and ye , it _is_ impress . 
but thi too is over-us , repeat the same view over and again on multipl occas . 
and , for the most part , babe _remain in the hotel_ . 
( ii ) given the limit of cromwel , the human element is taken over by `` the boss ' wife `` play by magda szubanski . 
s-t-r-e-t-c-h . 
she 's not a lead actress-typ , she 's not funni enough in her physic comedi , and she 's simpli embarrass in some of her pratfal . 
( have her arrest fals on drug charg ! 
have her accident incit a riot with biker dude and scantili clad babe ! 
have her bounc around on a bunge cord at a prestigi benefit dinner ! ) 
i wa hope for a littl smirk dure these scene , but i felt sorri for the embarrass that she put herself in . 
i am restrain myself from talk about the dark natur of the film , the violenc , the scene where a pit bull dangl from the bridg , head submerg underwat . 
even the best fairi tale have a bit of the macabr in it , as the brother grimm have demonstr . 
no . . . my problem is with the stori , or lack thereof . 
_babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but onc in the citi , that stori is forgotten . 
be a good-natur pig in the midst of the cynic of hi environ is nice , but , other than rescu that aforement pit bull , what did babe actual _do_ ? 
without give the end away , the farm is save from a left-field quirk that had noth to do with the pig . 
speak of `` pig `` , or , `` pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! `` . 
the word `` pig `` is so overus , had they chang it to an explet , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watch _scarface_ . 
thi is screenwrit ? 
further , i can not explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the mani scene where accid happen to good peopl in fantast elabor setup . 
had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equival of elmer fudd , mayb my reaction would have been soften . 
but to farmer hoggett ? 
hi wife ? 
an elderli mickey rooney ? 
much too irrever . 
( `` quick ! 
splice those sing mice into those scene ! `` ) . 
the film is n't a coloss failur . 
i did like glenn headley 's schmoozi chimpanze . 
i like the pink poodl . 
the dog on the cart , who momentarili think he 's in dog heaven . 
and a weird look guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employe and a judg . 
but most of the time , i wa look down , in boredom , or in embarrass over the hacked-up script . 
them sing mice , those chapter partit , the profici act of the anim -- none of these can compens for a stori . 
let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett look at pig , proud , say `` that 'll do , pig . 
that 'll do . `` 
that 's it . 
hope i did n't ruin it for you . 
but tell me thi : what the heck did that pig _do_ ?
