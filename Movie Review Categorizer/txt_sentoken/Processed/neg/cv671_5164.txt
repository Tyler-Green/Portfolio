david schwimmer ( from the televis seri `` friend `` ) star as a sensit ( and slightli neurot ) singl guy who get more than he expect from the griev mother ( barbara hershey ) of a classmat he ca n't rememb . 
hello mr . robinson ! 
though quit cute as a romant comedi , the pallbear is pace like a funer march . 
the charact act , react , and interact at half-spe , make for one * excruciatingli * long sit . 
( and what 's with the dreari light ? ) 
co-writer/director matt reev bring some snap to the stori 's midsect ; the film briefli come to life when our hero attempt to resolv hi feel for * anoth * classmat ( a veri appeal gwyneth paltrow ) . 
by thi time , though , most viewer will have either fled or fallen asleep . 
those tough soul who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy-ey schwimmer , a hound dog with a head cold , who can go for over an hour without ever chang hi express .
