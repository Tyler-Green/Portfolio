it 's not a bad thing to updat old stori . 
it 's done all the time in the oral tradit . 
the difficulti with thi film is not that the tale ha chang , it 's that it 's dri . 
the new cinderella , daniel ( drew barrymor ) is not sit around wait for her princ to come . 
she 's a woman of the late twentieth centuri albeit situat in sixteenth centuri franc . 
when her father die , she stay on in hi hous even though she is mistreat by her wick stepmoth rodmilla ( anjelica huston ) . 
she work by day , but read sir thoma more by firelight at night . 
although the stori is updat , you know the plot . 
daniel meet princ henri ( dougray scott ) , goe to a ball disguis , is later found out and they live happili ever after . 
the movi is often like watch a film play . 
theater in real life is engross . 
theater on the screen is usual lifeless . 
there doe n't seem to be much go on . 
the camera can be a star of film . 
here it 's a co-conspir . 
daniel 's convict are compromis . 
a socialist and a feminist , she pretend to be royalti to get her man . 
a kind woman , her last act in the movi is one of reveng . 
the most enjoy charact are the most cartoonish . 
the fairi godmoth stand-in , leonardo da vinci ( patrick godfrey ) is fun to watch as the eccentr old man who advis daniel . 
huston is enjoy in her over-the-top wicked . 
in all fair , my companion love the film . 
mayb it 's one of those `` chick flick `` that men do n't like . 
it is certainli a date film . 
nearli the entir audienc wa coupl . 
oh well , mayb it 's good for someth .
