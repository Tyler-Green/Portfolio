one of the respons those that enjoy `` detroit rock citi `` ( probabl kiss fan , mostli ) might have upon first glanc at the rate i 've given the film might be someth like : `` oh , that casey 's gone and becom a jade critic on us . 
just what did he expect out of a dumb teenag rock n ' roll movi like thi ? `` 
i 'm wonder the same thing . 
i feel like i should have had a grand time with `` detroit rock citi . `` 
it 's the sort of movi i wish i could 've had a lot of fun with , but i did n't . 
i just did n't . 
sure thi film is n't tri to win ani major award , so should i have expect an oscar-calib film ? 
no , but i expect someth . 
a funni joke . 
a clever prank . 
a plot develop . 
anyth . 
the movi never deliv . 
you 've got to marvel at how the filmmak manag to come up with a movi that is truli about noth . 
`` detroit rock citi `` is one of those film that you walk out of after the credit have roll and realiz that you just spent 90 minut watch a movi in which absolut noth happen to justifi the film 's exist , and it 's not a veri satisfi realiz . 
the film is about four teenag boy , all huge kiss fan from cleveland , tri to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan . 
that 's it . 
there is no big plot descript in thi review , becaus the movi ha veri littl plot . 
the charact are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giusepp andrew ) , trip ( jame debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) . 
they have a garag band . 
they 're pathet , like all garag band , but they like kiss and they like rock n ' roll , so i guess that mean we root for them . 
they have ticket , they lose them . 
they get more ticket , they lose those too . 
they come up with crazi scheme to get ticket , most of which backfir . 
there 's not much more to it . 
frankli , it becom a littl less than excit to see them tri to get kiss ticket about halfway through the film , when a total of eight ticket have alreadi grace the boy ' hand , onli to be lost becaus of their sheer stupid . 
oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) ha a realli , realli annoy ultra-religi mother who ought to be report to the child welfar agenc . 
she doe n't want them to see kiss , if you had n't figur that out alreadi . 
it 's realli quit dishearten to see such a fine soundtrack go to wast in a pointless movi like thi . 
we 've got plenti of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramon , and thin lizzi . 
then again , `` maximum overdr `` had an awesom soundtrack ( me be the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probabl one of the worst movi of all time . 
`` detroit rock citi `` doe n't quit reach that level of ineptitud , but it get danger close . 
in fact , the music is the onli thing that keep thi movi from be a complet failur in my mind . 
basic , the soundtrack ha earn the film a full half-star , which mean all the band involv can pat themselv on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-heart cover of ac/dc 's `` highway to hell `` sound like someth my neighbor 's cat cough up ) . 
it 's also realli sad to see the talent of the cast go to wast , becaus it ' s evid that they 're all tri realli hard to squeez some life out of thi dead turkey of a movi . 
edward furlong ha done far better work than thi , and so ha natasha lyonn , and so ha lin shay , but hey , they 've got to make a live in hollywood . 
peopl want to see kiss , and lot of it will probabl be disappoint , consid the band appear for about five minut and play one song . 
too bad , they might have provid some energi to thi mess . 
director adam rifkin know he ha n't got much materi to work with , so he take a chapter from the michael bay book of direct and keep hi camera spin . 
we get an endless parad of quick-cut , split-screen , zoom-out , zoom-in , and rotat camera , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupid of the script . 
it 's fun for a while , but eventu it becom disori . 
i would recommend that those who felt seasick at `` the blair witch project `` stay far away from `` detroit rock citi , `` becaus the witch ha got noth on thi babi . 
i have n't felt such an urg to reach out and hold the camera still sinc `` armageddon . `` 
and what about that script ? 
it 's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sound like as made-up a name as i 've ever heard . 
if it is , i ca n't say i blame the writer for distanc himself as far from thi script as possibl . 
a plotless , pointless rock n ' roll movi can be fun , if the joke and gag are actual funni . 
the joke in `` detroit rock citi `` rare are . 
in fact , the onli time i realli laugh wa when a priest get stone on a marijuana-lac pizza , and that wa just becaus it wa so surreal . 
the rest of the movi just seem like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and call it `` comedi . `` 
there is no set-up , just a success of punchlin that do n't provid for much in the way of chuckl , precis becaus there wa no set-up . 
it 's as if they just whack someon on the head , point at him and said , `` see ? 
funni ! `` 
look , that woman wa so shock by hear loud kiss music that she spill her drink . 
see ? 
funni ! 
look , that guy just got clock by a telephon receiv . 
twice . 
see ? 
funni ! 
look , that kid ha been vomit for 20 minut after drink an inordin amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exot danc for money . 
see ? 
funni ! 
a word of advic to mr . dupr ? : no , these thing are n't funni all by themselv . 
they must be preced by a clever set-up so the audienc hasn 't predict them five minut in advanc . 
that 's it , i 've said enough about thi movi . 
it 's a wast of time and money . 
i like the music , but do n't bother buy the soundtrack . 
i hear it ' s just modern band do inferior version of the song that are actual in the movi . 
you want to see thi concept execut well ? 
go rent roger corman 's 1979 classic `` rock n ' roll high school . `` 
it featur anoth late-seventi rock band ( the ramon ) and a far more interest stori about a girl tri to get ticket to their show . 
ye , go rent that , and skip `` detroit rock citi , `` which will probabl bomb , and deservedli so .
