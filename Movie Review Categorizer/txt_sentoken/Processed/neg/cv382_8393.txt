possibl the year the most anticip film and final it arriv here in the uk . 
it smash u . s box offic offic record in it 's open weekend and will no doubt do the same here . 
but is it ani good ? 
in a word , no . 
i 'll elabor further . 
the stori is as follow . 
appar there were two island with dinosaur on . 
one where the dino live untouch by mankind and the other a tourist attract which fail befor it even open . 
( see jurras park . ) 
imgen , the compani that fund jurras park , want to reccov their loss by take more dino off the other island and move them to a new attract in san diago . 
realiz what a bad idea thi is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decid to send a team to document the dinosaur , so as to ralli public support to preserv the island . 
enter familiar mumbl man jeff goldblum who onli agre to go when told hi girlfriend is alreadi there . 
so , basic , what you have is thi . 
two team , one sent to catch and move some dinosaur to the mainland and the other , tri to document them , be forc to work togeth , fight for surviv against the dinosaur ' firm intent on eat them . 
a fairli good idea , howev it 's let down by one slight problem . 
it 's crap . 
over two hour of chase scene get way too bore , way too quiclki . 
add to thi a terribl script and some feebl attempt at some occasion characteris and you end up veri disinterest . 
it becom background nois while your mind start concentr on thing like , 'what 's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ? ' 
( ye , you should ) . 
it 's a shame then realli , that spielberg ha lower himself into make what essenti is a blatant cash in , which add practic noth to the far superior jurras park . 
with onli a few creativ and genuin tens scene and fabul c . g . i 
dinosaur ( the t . rex 's have to be seen to be believ ) , there is noth els to recommend the lost world . 
a veri dissapoint sequel , inde .
