accord to popular film opinion , a film 's great is determin by time . 
take for exampl `` casablanca . `` 
great film , even today . 
it 's still as power as it wa when it came out and still as romant and tragic . 
anoth exampl would be `` star war , `` which had a veri , veri healthi box offic gross despit the fact that we had all seen it about 3 billion time befor . 
but as i rewatch `` independ day `` when it came out on video after be the number one hit of 1996 , i kinda felt like it wa n't as cool as when i had first seen it . 
i had like it when i saw it the first time ( * * * wa my origin view ) and basic saw it as a good `` escap film . `` 
but when i rewatch it , i felt cheat . 
thu , the curs of the `` event film . `` 
`` independ day `` is like that kid who come out of nowher and make everybodi happi at onc ( except for a coupl kid - the critic , in thi situat ) . 
but after a while , thi kid becom annoy and you just wait for the next one . 
well , thi kid is the `` event film `` in my littl analog . 
and when i rewatch `` independ day , `` not onli did it not look cooler at all on the big screen , but i felt insult the whole time . 
there are too mani gape crater in the plot and you just are n't sure if it 's comedi or hokey drama . 
one scene , you 'll see a hilari nebbish scene between jeff goldblum and judd hirsch ; the next you 'll see a bunch of militari uptight guy walk around , say corni line . 
the worst is a scene between brent spiner and bill pullman where spiner is sayinig someth innoc funni but is bark like a junkyard dog by bill pullman who give him the most unitent funniest speech sinc the end of `` glen or glenda ? `` 
now thi annoy kid 's problem is that in the process of tri to make everyon like him all at onc , he show he ha no ball . 
and `` independ day `` ha no ball . 
it play it safe everywher . 
it throw in a ton of action that is borrow from other superior film . 
the chase scene between the alien ship and will smith is straight out of `` star war . `` 
i mean , is n't that devil 's den ? 
and the alien are about as anticlimact as demi moor 's breast in `` stripteas . `` 
they 're these octopu men , bore freak octopu men . 
i mean , come on . 
the alien in `` 2001 `` were more interest and you did n't even see them ! 
basic the plot is straight from a b-movi from the 50 : alien come to earth and we wonder if they 're hostil or peac . 
okay , it 's an interest topic , but it 's not handl greatli . 
now they are n't and somehow a comput geek , jeff goldblum , figur out they 're use our satellit as a countdown to destruct . 
yep . 
these alien are not onli heavili arm , they 're stupid too . 
they also use the same kind of comput as we do , but that come about later . 
the presid ( bill pullman ) , who 's under attack for be a wimp , decid thi would be a nice time to be belliger , and he decid he 'll stay in the white hous which the alien have cover . 
i do n't care if it 's bob freak dole in the white hous , get him out of there . 
i do n't care if you have to inject him with sodium pentathol , just get him out of there . 
later on , he 's stupid and want to fli in the attack on a big alien ship . 
i think it 's time for impeach for thi guy . 
he 's more senil than reagan on pot . 
then there 's a cocki pilot ( will smith ) who is the onli person to surviv the counter-attack on the second day and becom mose in lead hi children to the elus area 51 ( the film 's onli sign of be brave ) . 
hi girlfriend 's a stripper share a subplot with `` stripteas `` in that she ha to do it for her son . 
come on , she ha a fighter pilot boyfriend/soon-to-b fianc . 
i think she can quit that job and get a more respect job at long john silver . 
she 's also the few , the proud , the lucki to surviv the ignit of l . a . ( as well as her dog , who narrowli surviv ) . 
there are some bright spot . 
they toss in enough old film homag to keep me laugh . 
the best one is when jeff goldblum ( nice name david ) turn on hi comput and a pictur of hal come up and say , `` good morn , dave . `` 
and they even play r . e . m . 's 
`` it 's the end of the world as we know it ( and i feel fine ) at the begin . 
and judd hirsch steal the film by actual act great ( he 's a stereotyp , but i just love the man anyway ) . 
but there are no real subtl comic moment . 
will get way too mani one-lin and he ha no one to play off of ( execept jeff toward the end , and the two do great ) . 
as i said , thi film ha no ball . 
it is just aim for a crowd pleaser and that 's what it is . 
but after a coupl month , we all move on to the next `` event `` film while intak littl film and a coupl indi one for good measur . 
but at least the indi one last for a lifetim . 
thi one 's short on batteri .
