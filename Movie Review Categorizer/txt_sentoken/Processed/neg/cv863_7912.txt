to put it bluntli , ed wood would have been proud of thi . 
a total ridicul plot is encompass with bad humor , hokey drama , zero logic and a crap screenplay . 
also , a beauti anti-climact end . 
not to say it did n't look intrigu when i saw the preview . 
so much for truth in advertis . 
roland emmerich , who 's later `` independ day `` would look like `` the 400 blow `` compar to thi , co-writ and direct thi inan sci-fi film which use the clich of there be some connect between eqypt and alien . 
in a useless open sequenc , men find a stone in 1914 with hieroglyph on it . 
it would n't be till present day ( '94 ) till they would actual figur it out . 
they 're decipher ? 
a slightly-neurot scientist ( nice twist ) , dr . dan jackson ( jame spader , do hi best outsid of erot thriller and some indi fare ) who 's life suck so much that peopl walk out of hi lectur after the third word . 
whi do they use him to deciph what no one els could ? 
so there is a hokey end ! 
duh ! 
he figur it out in about a minut . 
yea . 
and then they get a suicid colonel or someth , `` jack `` o'neil ( kurt russel , with hi wyat earp lock in the begin then a flat-top that would make howi long snap into a fetal posit ) . 
whi a suicid colonel ? 
for the end ! 
you 'll get the hang of thi . 
they open the stargat , a bunch of them go through it with a bomb to blow it up if they find anyth bad . 
after an overdon special effect thing , they 're . . . insid a goddam pyramid . 
so they went to egypt , right ? 
wrong . 
they 're on anoth planet that wa film in egypt . 
they discov a cilvil rule by ra , the sun god ( the androgin jay davidson , with a voic modifi to make him sound like barri white with asthma ) , and there are fight , explos and a kiss between two peopl . 
yea . 
also melodrama , stupid , hokey scene and a bizarr languag . 
an anti-climact end end with stupid line ( `` say hello to king tut , asswhol ! `` 
- the quintessenti line , lem me tell ya ) and some conveni pesudo-pseudo-pseudo-charact develop . 
by the end , you just wan na go home and watch , i do n't know , the `` outer limit `` or someth . 
the script 's terribl . 
the special effect are okay , but noth great . 
the stori 's so weak that it 's almost opaqu . 
the whole experi just is n't worth it unless you 're so bore that you 'd consid watch a `` full hous `` marathon . . . or 
thi . 
i 'd pick thi , obvious , but still , it 's just not fun at all . 
and i ca n't wait for it to premier on mst3k .
