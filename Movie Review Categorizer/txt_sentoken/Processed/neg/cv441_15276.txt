year ago , robin william made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achiev in special effect , but a travesti on nearli everi other level . 
the same can be said for _what dream may come_ , a bore , illog , weepie-wannab that left my sens numb . 
do n't get me wrong : i love breathtak special effect and pulse-pound imageri . 
_brazil_ is on my person top ten . 
_the citi of lost children_ is a great film becaus of it outlandish scenario . 
i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , be in the minor amidst my friend . 
_what dream may come_ , imageri asid , ha littl dare thought to complement it imageri . 
the dare thought it _does_ have is never fulli realiz . 
it 's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insult the bigger question it rais . 
it would have been better if the filmmak rid the film of the live action sequenc , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind 's eye_ video . 
robin william play chri nielsen , who die too prematur -- not onli in the stori , but befor we have a chanc to realli know and care for him . 
the director , vincent ward , and the screenwrit ronald bass , have chosen to tell hi life stori in flashback while have the foreground stori focu on hi experi with the afterlif . 
big mistak . 
it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so need to tell hi life stori first ( ala _it 's a wonder life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibl care for him , hi children , and hi long-suff wife ( play superbl by annabella sciorra ) . 
instead , the filmmak insult my intellig by rush into the stori , expect that the film to grow in depth as it progress . 
it doe n't . 
so in the afterlif , chri learn that ( a ) peopl still do n't meet god , ( b ) that our thought are realiti , and ( c ) time doe not exist there . 
hmm . . . 
i+ll grant one of those silli giant idea for the sake of the narr . 
( the `` not meet god `` part still irk at me , but perhap there wa no possibl way to film it and give it due respect ) . 
that said , thi altern realiti still make no possibl sens . 
read on . . . 
chri ' wife commit suicid . 
sinc suicid go to hell , chri would be separ from hi wife forev . 
the import question is , is heaven realli heaven if you are separ from the one you love ? 
good question . 
and i like good thought-provok question . 
i don+t like it when the filmmak deviat from the question . 
i _loathe_ it when the filmmak deviat from the question so that the film becom a popular rescu film , especi a rescu film which doe not take it underli premis serious . 
i _really_ loath it when it+ stori is no longer run by logic , but by special effect . 
hey chri : did you forget ? 
your thought are _real_ . 
they are more _real_ than the physic world , accord to the new-ag screenplay . 
so , whi don+t you conjur up posit thought of anni , and let that run wild ? 
and then she would appear befor you , and you two would live in happi bliss for etern ? 
becaus there would be no movi , that+ whi . 
and albert the angel ( play by miscast cuba good , jr . ) say bluntli : `` that+ fantasi . `` 
umm . . . 
if your thought are more real than the physic , then fantasi is not fantasi , but real . 
sure some eastern medit specialist would be abl to tell you that . 
and if you happen to think that you are an unimagin person , and that your thought are n't big enough to sustain you for etern , well , in all due respect , that 's whi i do n't subscrib to thi theolog . 
all due respect . 
anoth idea , base on `` time , ( paus ) , doe not exist here ! `` 
so chri , spend your etern with anni , as she is on earth , reliv your favorit memori , or hang out with her when she wa grow up . 
you+v got etern : perhap you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out . 
and forc her to write `` i still exist `` in her diari , imo , is just too tacki . 
there are mani other idea , all of which are a hundr time better than what+ unravel in the plot . 
the great aforement question is sidetrack into gimmicki subplot that have been done befor , and just come out stale . 
most insult is the subplot where import peopl in chris+ life appear in heaven differ than he expect , so when they final show themselv , he realiz they were with him all along . 
and when thi happen , the film run in slow motion , as if to build emot . 
_gag me with a spoon_ . 
so the onli thing for me to like are sciorra+ effect perform , who rise far abov thi mundan materi , and the special effect . 
pleas note that while i enjoy some of the visual , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the imag look like sandi duncan univers , everybodi float up and down in invis string . 
it sound like a joke , but it+ realli true : i realli tri to block out the dialogu , and figur out what music would best work as an altern soundtrack . 
my vote goe to a rare cd call `` never say die `` ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group . 
it+ pretti good , and they have a song about anni , who commit suicid . 
( it+ too late for annie/she+ gone away for good/there+ so much we 'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+ too late . . . ) . 
melanchol , ye . 
depress , ye . 
but far more entertain . . . 
so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight . 
suicid -- bad . 
_don+t do it_ . 
no . no . no . ( got it ? -- you 
shouldn+t have to pay $ 7 . 50 to hear thi in an aw robin william schmaltzfest . )
