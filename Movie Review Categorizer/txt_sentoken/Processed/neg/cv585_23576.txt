the ad make `` hang up `` seem like an upbeat comedi about a rascal father and hi three daughter . 
anyon who went to the movi expect that left disappoint . 
all of the movi 's funni scene were includ in the ad . 
so what do we get ? 
eve mark ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozel ( walter matthau ) into a hospit . 
onc upon a time , lou wa a hollywood screenwrit who collabor with hi now-estrang wife . 
hi one great moment in life wa write a film for john wayn , who gave him a giant bullet-shap trophi . 
now lou is senil and deterior rapidli . 
eve tri to convinc her sister georgia ( dian keaton ) and maddi ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is die and need them . 
both are slow to show concern . 
so devot eve stand vigil over her father , who constantli ask for hi favorit daughter georgia , while run her own busi ( plan special event ) and care for her son ( jess jame ) . 
( some comic relief come when maddi also drop off her ail st . bernard for eve to care for . ) 
the tension build until all three sister are final in one room at one of eve 's event where georgia is the keynot speaker . 
there 's a superfici resembl to shakespear 's `` king lear `` ( senil king with three daughter : one devot saint and two selfish bitch ) , but the materi is appar drawn from life . 
sister screenwrit delia and nora ephron had parent who were a success hollywood write team . 
henri and phoeb ephron collabor on 17 screenplay , includ `` desk set `` and `` there 's no busi like show busi . `` 
( delia 's novel , the basi for the film , is dedic to henri ) . 
surprisingli , the script is as thin as an anorex 's wet dream . 
the virtu of a semi-autobiograph project would seem to be the wealth of materi avail . 
yet , the ephron provid onli the barest minimum of inform about their charact . 
also , the space they inhabit seem artifici . 
eve live in a hous that look like a magazin layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we ca n't feel sorri for anyon whose hous is so pristin on ani given day . 
georgia is a famou magazin editor , and in her brief scene while she chat on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profil . 
when we first meet maddi , she 's fish at a picturesqu mountain stream . 
i expect to see the credit `` cinematographi by 'vaniti fair . ' `` 
and , ye , dian keaton is liter old enough to be lisa kudrow 's mother . 
to her credit , though , she look young enough to pull it off . 
the one redeem aspect of `` hang up `` is that , at it core , is a truth about sibl . 
there 's alway one on which everyon els in the famili reli , free the other to be selfish and emot distant . 
my wife is the reliabl child in her famili ; for better or wors , my brother ha the role in mine . 
( be selfish and emot distant may not be fulfil , but it is a lot less work ) . 
if you have noth better to do than watch thi movi , look for a power cameo by clori leachman as the sister ' mother pat . 
in a devast scene , eve discov that her mother doe n't love her . 
although leachman is best known for comedi like `` young frankenstein `` and `` the mari tyler moor show , `` her perform here remind me of the consider dramat talent she display in `` the last pictur show . `` 
bottom line : everyon involv ha live in hollywood so long they do n't recogn real life anymor .
