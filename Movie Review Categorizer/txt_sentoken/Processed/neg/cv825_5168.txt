if anyon had been abl in 1983 to forse a late-night cabl show host by gilbert gottfri showcas some of the worst film of the 80 's , they 'd agre d . c . cab is the quintessenti `` usa up all nite `` movi . 
it 's one of those childish r-rate movi that kid would love but ca n't see until it 's edit for tv . 
it 's also one of those pointless , almost plotless movi with hardli ani laugh . 
and , strike three , it pair mr . t with gari busey . 
i heard gilbert say d . c . cab had `` an all-star cast , `` but i 'm still hope there wa some degre of faceti in that statement . 
when third-bil goe to a two-minut appear by fame flashdanc iren cara `` as herself , `` you ca n't say a damn thing about all-star cast . 
likewis for token appear by marsha `` roz `` warfield , paul rodriguez and `` polit incorrect `` host bill maher , befor he wa somebodi . 
appear in d . c . cab pretti much had the opposit effect on everyon els , especi iren `` i 'm gon na live forev `` cara . 
d . c . cab is an ensembl comedi from joel schumach ( who would go on to direct batman forev ) about a bunch of misfit who drive cab . 
you get the feel if the polic academi cadet had made a differ career choic , thi would be the result , except here you have such interest charact as the `` token white guy `` ( busey ) who want to get in tight with the black now befor they take over the world , the token jive talker name tyron ( charli barnett ) who wear hi hair in roller and use the word `` honkey `` as much as possibl , the tough guy with the mohawk and gold chain ( mr . t -- a real stretch for him ) , the aspir musician wait for hi big break ( maher ) , the mexican gigolo ( rodriguez ) , the woman who actual want to drive cab for a live ( warfield ) and the guy who want to own a cab compani for a live ( adam baldwin ) . 
we 've all seen dozen of bad comedi from the 80 's . 
some are fun to watch and some are actual funni . 
thi one is more or less neither . 
you 'd think plenti of comed spark would fli from the assemblag of talent ( whatev ) , but d . c . cab more or less fall flat on a continu basi , culmin in the usual contriv hollywood final as baldwin is kidnap and the other cabbi have to go to rescu him . 
it 's a shame no one wa abl to rescu thi movi from the depth of stale joke and unorigin . 
d . c . cab ha rightli earn it posit on `` usa up all nite . ``
