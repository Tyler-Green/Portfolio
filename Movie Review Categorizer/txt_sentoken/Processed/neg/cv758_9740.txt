it wa with a huge lack of someth to do that i decid to watch thi on good old upn on sunday afternoon , when the onli good thing on tv are the second-r movi they show ( some are good : they show `` total recal `` befor thi one ) . 
if you know me , i think seagal is probabl the most bore action star to ever live . 
and thi includ keanu reev . 
what do i hate about seagal ? 
i hate how he use one facial express for everi singl threaten and non-threaten situat ( the squint ) . 
i hate those scene in everi movi where he goe around , bulli peopl up , say stupid line with a brooklyn accent more fake than burt reynold 's hairpiec in `` boogi night . `` 
i despis how he never get a bruis in ani of hi fight . 
i hate how everi singl plot twist lead to just a melodramat fight between he and the chief villain . 
i hate hi non-satir messag ( in the begin of thi one , he slap on a quot from arthur miller , which ha noth to do with the film , except it 's about brooklyn where thi film take place ) . 
and i hate how he 's so narcissist that he think that he can actual fuck sing ( dure the end credit , he ha a good old hill billi rock tune sung and pen by him ) . 
sure , the guy 's probabl a nice guy in person ( i actual found him veri non-threaten when he wa on letterman not too long ago ) . 
but the guy make wors film than reagan did . 
so what 's the plot of thi shit-terpiec ? 
well . . . someth 
about him tri to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsyth ) who shot and kill hi partner in broad daylight . 
i could n't believ how bad thi scene wa - the guy wa conveni with hi famili so we get the maximum emot effect ( ahem ! ) . 
and forsyth even said some stupid line to him befor he took off . 
i 'm sorri , did anyon ever hear of conceal one 's self ? 
so in come ex-brooklynit seagal , who dedic hi life to catch thi guy . 
and i just wish he had caught him in the begin , then end the film . 
but noooo , thi drag on , as he bulli forsyth 's famili member ( includ a stupid bar-own , and none other than gina gershon as hi other bar-own sister ) . 
and forsyth more than onc threaten hi famili . 
at one point , he actual come to their hous and stalk them like a non-threaten nicholson in `` the shine `` ( complet with them all hide in the bathroom , but with an ad bonu of one girl conveni loos her cool and scream to give them away ) . 
seagal paint himself as a lovabl person , with a son , and a fiance . 
he even show him hang with hi son , check up on hi homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of `` catch , `` when he 's conveni call away on assign . 
i dunno about you , but play `` catch `` with seagal wa one of my childhood nightmar . 
he also show him as that bad-ass he want to be , with scene of him bulli crook around , and take out peopl who are stupid enough to attack him even after he 's unarm a chines guy swing bat with a pool cue . 
serv them right . 
thi film , as some of hi do , ha an interest support cast of actor who are actual talent , but do n't appear to be in thi film . 
i alreadi mention gina gershon ( who 's pretti horribl in thi one ) , as well as william forsyth , who over-act terribl . 
i know thi guy can act : he wa awesom in `` rais arizona `` as goodman 's partner in crime . 
but he 's just aw here . 
jerri orbach give the onli credibl perform in the film as the polic chief who check up on segal after thing have gone down . 
whi is he the onli one who give a good perform ? 
well , becaus hi role is small enough and sporad enough to not tarnish hi credibl . 
he seem to be in here just to give it a cool `` law and order `` feel ( even if it 's not a `` cool `` feel ) . 
and in cameo are b-rate erotic-thriller-cinemax-styl star , shannon whirri ( as `` terri malloy , `` which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey . 
oh ! 
and `` er `` 's julliana margiul ha two scene . 
`` out for justic `` just prove onc again that american action film just suck . 
i know that there 's such a good thing as good action - he 's call john woo . 
but if you 're in the mood for some good old no-brain , fun-yet-dumb action , do n't bother watch thi . 
it 's so stupid that it 's bore .
