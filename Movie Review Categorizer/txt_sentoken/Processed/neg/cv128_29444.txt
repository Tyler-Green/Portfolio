susan granger 's review of `` ghost of mar `` ( soni pictur entertain ) 
horror auteur john carpent ( `` halloween , `` `` vampir `` ) strike out with thi sci-fi eco-f that 's so bad it boggl the mind to imagin how the project ever got green-lit . 
the script by carpent and larri sulki appear to have been lift directli from last year 's `` pitch black , `` involv a violent prison who must be releas from bondag so that he can help a small band of human protect themselv from blood-thirsti , maraud alien . 
in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthl on mar , live in a matriarch societi led by a command , play by pam grier . 
grier , pill-poppin ' natasha henstridg , and some rooki mar polic offic ( clea duval , jason statham ) travel to the remot mine town of shine canyon to fetch `` desol `` william - that 's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse citi to stand trial for murder . 
but when they 're besieg by dement , zombie-lik , body-snatch miner , they readili free the scowl ice cube sinc they need him for protect . 
it seem a red cloud wa releas from a shine canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miner went bonker as long-dorm remnant of an ancient martian civil took over their mind and bodi , lop off head as `` vengeanc for anyth that tri to lay claim to their planet , `` accord to a scientist ( joanna cassidi ) . 
carpent use so mani flashback to tell the `` night of the live dead `` -like stori that the idiot plot get incomprehens confus . 
but you can easili predict each of the support charact who will be kill , along with the order of their elimin . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` ghost of mar `` thud to a labori , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . 
perhap , inde , there is a curs on mar film , if you recal two other dud : `` mission to mar `` and `` red planet . ``
