it 's a good thing most anim sci-fi movi come from japan , becaus `` titan a . e . `` is proof that hollywood doe n't have a clue how to do it . 
i do n't know what thi film is suppos to be about . 
from what i can tell it 's about a young man name kale who 's one of the last survivor of earth in the earli 31st centuri who unknowingli possess the key to save and re-gener what is left of the human race . 
that 's a fine premis for an action-pack sci-fi anim movi , but there 's no payoff . 
the stori take the main charact all over the galaxi in their search for a legendari ship that the evil `` dredg `` alien want to destroy for no appar reason . 
so in the process we get a lot of spaceship fight , fistfight , blaster fight and more double-cross than you can shake a stick at . 
there 's so much pointless sci-fi banter it 's too much to take . 
the galaxi here is a total rip-off of the `` star war `` univers the creator do n't bother fill in the basic detail which make the stori confus , the charact unmotiv and superfici and the plot just plain bore . 
despit the fantast anim and special effect , it 's just not an interest movi .
