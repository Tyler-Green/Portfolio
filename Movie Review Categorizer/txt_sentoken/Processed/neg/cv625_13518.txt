if i were to plot a graph of year against movie-plot-ridicul for = hollywood movi , you 'll probabl see a line with constant gradient . 
= now , if i were to plot that same graph for the movi that the michael = bay/jerri bruckheim ha made over the last 4 year , that line would be = exponenti in growth . 
the team start out with the will smith vehicl = bad boy which wa no more than a 2hr long action-music-video , = nevertheless entertain . 
then came the rock , where audienc flock = to see nichola cage team up with sean conneri against some terror = gener fight over some stupid caus . 
con-air wa ridiculousi dumb in = it premis but it did have fun moment , and who can forget the nurseri = rhyme sang by that psycho killer play by steve buscemi . 
while these = movi work becaus there wa someth better to cover-up the dirt , = armageddon doe not . 
veri much like deep impact , a meteor is head toward earth and they = did n't realiz it until 18 day from impact . 
deep impact settl with = the modest meteor size as larg as the citi of new york but armageddon = just had to be bigger . . . . well 
about the size of texa ( that kinda meteor = whould probabl knock earth out of it orbit ! ) . 
the panic of thi = sight spur the idea of land peopl on the meteor , drill it then = nuke it ( sound familiar ) and who better to do such a job than harri = stamper ( bruce willi ) , your veri own oil-dril extraordinair and = hi team of macho-misfit , nurs the taglin ` there ai n't nothin ' on = thi planet that harri ca n't drill ! ' . 
in that 18 day , harri 's group wa = split into 2 team , train for deep-spac flight and final blast = into space in with special drill vehicl on 2 new space shuttl . 
the main relationship drama of armageddon is form within the = relationship of harri , a . j . 
and grace . 
to give you an idea , a . j . 
work = for harri , and love grace , harri 's daughter . 
the problem is , harri = hate to see hi daughter hang around some scruffi grunt like himself = for the rest of her life . 
so while a . j . 
and harri strut it out , grace = is place in a posit where she is unabl to take side , so she remain = seat in the nasa control tower , cri over both of them in about 80 % = of the movi . 
the human element thi movi tri to inject prove to be noth more = than just an excus for more slow-mo 's and gold-tint photographi . 
the = anguish of the world is potray with scene of peopl pray , run = for their live or just sit still stare at the sky , sound fine = right ? 
i know , but it look too out of place on screen , too stage . 
if = you were to ask yourself , ` what 's the differ between armageddon and = a r & b music video ? `` 
you 'd probabl just said ` the music . `` . 
not = surpris sinc michael bay is a child of that industri and ha = actual manag to transpos hi mtv skill to screen success . 
hi = foray into armageddon just prove that he doe n't when to stop . 
well there 's realli noth much to sum up here . 
the = stock-aitken-waterman of hollywood movi have project their art-form = into ridicul , beyond the plane believ , where peopl still = accept even if they did n't believ . 
deep impact wa ridicul in most = aspect and i believ the maker know thi . 
the thing is , they decid = to shroud myth and fantasi with a pure believ human tale of = suffer and come in term with one problem , which ultim = brought it abov the ash which it had initi put itself in . 
= armageddon , is an overcrowd , loud , messi , preposter manipul = wast of money and deserv to remain in that same pile of ash . . =20 
if you have plan to watch thi over deep impact becaus of liv = tyler , bruce willi or the taglin `` from the maker of ` the rock ' ! ! `` . 
= pleas catch deep impact befor it finish it run , it may be the onli = meteor worth watch in long-long time . 
if you have to see it , pleas = bring ear-plug and some aspirin ( for the vertigo ) . 
expect armageddon = ld 's to retail at s $ 19 . 90 at carrefour come releas time . 
gee . . . . . . even 
= that 's not worth it !
