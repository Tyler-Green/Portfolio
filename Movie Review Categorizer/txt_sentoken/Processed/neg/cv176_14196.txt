hello kid . 
today the movi studio want to take over my critic review , and somehow persuad you that _armageddon_ , the summer 's biggest blockbust , is a film for everybodi . 
and rememb , if a film is for _everybody_ , and if it make the most money for the summer , it _must_ be good , right ? 
armageddon is a comedi , with a capit `` c `` . 
it star bruce willi , who ha a hundr one-lin ! 
it ha a tini rock land directli in the middl of a heat argument in new york citi ! ! 
and , chuckl , chuckl , one of those new yorker , _survives_ , with charcoal all over hi face ! ! 
snorkl , * sniff * , hiccup . 
and it ha steve buscemi as a _genius_ who want to work for an oil rig ? 
knee-slap ! ! 
is n't thi just so , so , funni ! ? 
armageddon also ha romanc , with a capit `` r `` . 
it ha a tender moment between * forbidden lover * ben affleck and liv tyler , with , with , anim cracker ! 
and it ha will patton as a long lost husband tri to reunit with hi separ wife and child , who think he 's a salesman ! 
gurgl , * sniff * , awwwww . 
and it ha steve buscemi spew more one-lin about minor and stripper . 
umm , move right along . . . 
armageddon also ha lot of action , with a capit `` a `` . 
not just ani action sequenc would do . 
it must have _original_ action sequenc that are design to thrill . 
like , drill , darn it , drill ! ! ! 
and , let 's have inept peopl destroy the mir space station ! ! 
ca n't you hear your heart beat ! ? 
and steve buscemi goe crazi and start shoot at peopl ! ! 
what drama ! ! 
lastli , armageddon is out there to save the planet , with a capit `` p `` . 
thi ca n't be ani old thriller -- we must have an asteroid , the size of texa head straight for earth ! ! 
and , and , we must have beauti scenic worldwid shot , like pari , blown up . 
and , and , we must have peopl of all color , nation , and religion , join hand in hand for one final , hope , hug . 
the final sequenc , where muslim in prostrat worship stand up -- in domino fashion -- to cheer the victori , fill me with such emot goo that i want to , to , to rip the screen into shred ! ! 
i mean , i mean , cheer for ecstat joy ! 
( it wa over ) . 
comedi . `` c `` . 
romanc . 
`` r `` . 
action . 
`` a `` . 
planet . 
`` p `` . 
okay , kid , what doe that spell ? 
serious , folk . 
ani film that could take the indie-film ' most valuabl talent , and throw it all away with a bruce willi vehicl , a hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o set and lousi special effect , is , bottom line , live proof that hell exist , and ha made a multi-pictur deal with univers . 
in the midst of all the action , the ters , the one-lin , the fake set , the overal wast of time , i recogn matt malloy play an underwritten nasa technician ( `` malloy , give me a read `` ) . 
rememb him ? 
he wa a princip player in last year 's _in the compani of men_ , a film that wa more power , shock , terrifi , funni , and shock than _armageddon_ could ever aspir to be . 
_armageddon_ cost over $ 100 million to make . 
_itcom_ cost a paltri $ 30 , 000 . 
need i say more ?
