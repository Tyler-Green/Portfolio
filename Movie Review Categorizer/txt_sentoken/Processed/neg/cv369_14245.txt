renown hong kong action director tsui hark first team with jean-claud van damm on the action star 's 1997 pair with denni rodman , _double_team_ , and manag to make what initi appear to be a disast into a slick , stylish , and somewhat divert action timekil . 
tsui continu to energet pile on the visual razzl dazzl in hi latest collabor with the muscl from brussel , _knock_off_ , but thi time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridicul , and at worst incomprehens ; nor hide a host of truli lousi perform . 
writer steven e . desouza 's fairli straightforward plotlin is n't as outr as _double_team_ 's strang yarn involv a secret think tank/prison , but it make about as much sens , which is littl . 
van damm play marcu ray , a hong kong-bas sale rep for a jean compani ( ! ) who stumbl upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant power microchip-s bomb in hk product export to the u . s . -- doll , electron equip , and , ye , jean . 
it 's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i rememb is -- and i kid you not -- graphic on a cia comput screen show a map of the world , bomb deton , and an hat-wear figur on the other side of the world burst out into laughter . . . 
. . . which is what the crowd at the show i attend spontan did throughout _knock_off_ . 
while all of van damm 's film have it share of unintent laugh , mostli due to the stiff act `` skill `` of the physic agil van damm , _knock_off_ deliv more than usual ( though not as mani as van damm 's embarrass directori effort , 1996 's _the_quest_ ) . 
a lot of the laugh are earn by some particularli pain line by desouza : `` i smoke that badass like a roman candl ! `` 
and `` entrepreneurship , babycak ! `` 
stand out among my favorit . 
but it is inde the pathet perform that provid the bulk of _knock_off_ 's laugh . 
van damm is true to laughabl form , perhap even wors than usual . 
earli scene actual _require_ him to make funni with co-star rob schneider ( improb cast as a deep cover cia agent pose as marcu 's busi partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-acc van damm haplessli tri to drop punchlin is hilari in the wrong way . 
even typic good actor are not immun to the bad act bug . 
paul sorvino is unconvinc and terribl overwrought as schneider 's cia superior ; and lela rochon , play an investig for the jean compani , spend the entir movi in perpetu snarl mode . 
in rochon 's defens , though , her role requir her to do littl more than display her tone leg , exquisit bone structur , and perki bosom , the latter come in handi for one key scene where she must fish for microbomb stuck in her ampl cleavag . 
tsui pick up where he left off visual in _double_team_ , juic up the proceed with invent camera work . 
here , though , tsui 's visual razzl dazzl border on over kill , come off as desper attempt to shield the inan of the entir enterpris . 
for each nifti trick tsui pull off , such as a recur visual theme that ha the camera liter go through the circuitri of electron devic , there are other that are complet superflu . 
thi is especi disconcert when the trick in question could be clever when use in the right context . 
for instanc , one scene earli on ha marcu put hi hand in a box . 
as he put hi hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angl in a rectangl at the corner of the screen . 
it 's undoubtedli an interest visual , but it would have been nice if it use actual amount to someth . 
the test of a van damm movi boil down to the action sequenc , but surprisingli , those in _knock_off_ leav much to be desir . 
tsui doe what he can to make someth of them , employ freez frame , blur motion , and unconvent camera angl , but there is noth fundament special about the fairli gener chase and fight sequenc written by desouza . 
there is n't anyth as preposter amus as the climact tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alon anyth remot close to tsui 's legendari hong kong work ( but that 's a given go in ) . 
if tsui ha ani hope of approach hi countryman john woo 's statesid success , he would do best to break free from van damm . . . 
befor it 's too late . 
if he continu hi involv with b-grade movi such as _knock_off_ , the respect he ha from hk action fan will continu to diminish . . . 
that is , if it ha n't alreadi disappear entir after thi fiasco .
