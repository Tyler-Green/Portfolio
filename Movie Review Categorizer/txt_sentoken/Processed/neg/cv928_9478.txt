martial art master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) ha built a career out of play an allegedli fictiti martial art superman who never get hurt in fight , talk in a hush tone , and squint at ani sign of danger . 
he 's also the most consist individu in hollywood today , sinc all hi movi suck . 
they basic repres hi egotisit tendenc about hi art ( that is , martial art ) . 
i 'm sure the guy 's good , and he seem like a nice guy on talk show , although a tad haughti , but these movi he make are all the same : a guy who is basic indestruct , is mayb wound supposedli mortal , then come back with a vengeanc and goe buddha on all the baddi ass ( although i kinda like `` under sieg `` ) . 
of cours , thi one , as a chang , ha a `` messag `` that is drill into our mind . . . of 
cours , after he blow up a lot of stuff and kill a bunch of peopl . 
so whi do i watch hi crap ? 
i usual do n't . 
i will never , and you can hold me to thi , i will never pay to see thi man 's movi , unless , and onli unless , he 's in a support role ( i . e . 
`` execut decis `` ) and i 'd definit pay if he die ( i . e . 
`` execut decis `` ) . 
but thi one ha a special place in my heart . 
thi doe n't mean it 's good or that i even like it . 
thi wa the last movi i watch with my deceas uncl , and we had one hell of a time rip it apart a la `` mysteri scienc theatr 3000 , `` and thi wa a coupl year befor i had heard of `` mysteri scienc theatr 3000 . `` 
in thi one , seagal play a worker for a mine factori set in alaska and run by the greased-up typic shallow villain , thi time play by an oscar-winn to give the movi some more clout - michael cain . 
it seem that cain want to do someth with hi oil factori that includ him dump oil all over inuit land . 
around the 20-30 minut point , seagal speak up to him in what seem to be the typic speech to all the vain entrepeneur ( what with hi new `` fire down below , `` anoth `` messag film `` ) , and cain ha him bump off . . . or 
doe he ? 
seagal is rescu by some inuit , and fall in love with one of them , play by joan chen , who can act , hypothet , but , for some reason , not here . 
one of cain 's clich henchmen ( play here with a lot of overact by john c . mcginley ) shoot the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyag to take down the oil factori . . . liter , 
of cours . 
at one point , seagal give a wonder hyster speech about how he doe n't have ani option but blow stuff up . 
he even goe as far as to say , `` i do n't want to kill someon , `` and in the same breath , he ask some guy where the arsen is . 
i have no problem with violenc . 
i 'm a huge john woo fan , but he paint hi film with suspens , skill , style , depth , character , and just plain cool violenc . 
in the film of seagal , the suspens mainli consist of the baddi attack him stupidli , and him either wound or kill them . 
at some point , they use the clich of the talk villain , where the villain ha the advantag , can shoot seagal , but begin talk by either tell him hi big secret plan , or say a corni line , to which seagal say someth hokey back , and ha had enough time to devis of a way to do away with them , and doe . 
thi would be okay if there were ani suspens or if it did n't take itself serious at all , like in the case of thi summer 's `` con air . `` 
but seagal is seriou about hi skill , and of cours , hi messag . 
i would n't mind if thi wa a messag film in the way that they present it to you with evid . 
but seagal ha no idea how to present a film where the messag is subtl , not pound into the viewer 's mind . 
the villain is total shallow and cartoonish , thu we ca n't take him and hi motiv serious , and while seagal talk about be kind to the environ , he also goe ahead and blow up a squar mile of rig , and kill some worker who were just do hi job . 
then at the end , he spend a good 10 minut give a speech , just in case you did n't get the messag from the trailer . 
what seagal doe n't realiz is that no one take hi film serious ( although mayb a coupl do ) and ani messag he ha is no onli redund , but doe n't comfort fit in hi film , which is fill to the brim with hokey violenc , crap suspens , stupid melodrama , and charact who have about as much emot depth as a petri dish . 
as far as seagal and hi act , he 's rather bore . 
he squint , he kill . 
period . 
noth els . 
oh , yeah , there 's corni one-lin ( `` i 'm gon na reach out and touch someon ! `` ) . 
of cours , he 's the star , and we 're suppos to root for him and all , so he make all the villain unbeliev stupid and a bunch of jerk . 
michael cain , who 's a great actor , is just suppos to yell and look cold . 
he doe it well , i guess , but thi is no `` alfi . `` 
of cour , no one wa expect that calib of perform from him . 
hi big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda bore as well , but is not horribl . 
and we even get a small perform from that god of drill sergeant on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from `` full metal jacket `` ) as a hire assasin squad leader who get to say the obligatori speech about how danger seagal is , just for the movi trailer and for seagal 's ego . 
and also , look for billi bob thornton as one of ermey 's assasin . 
anyway , to conclud thi all , to judg one of seagal 's movi is to judg all of them ( except for `` under sieg `` and `` execut decis , `` though the latter is not realli a `` seagal movi `` ) . 
they all have thi same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but thi one ha that messag , which make it more excrucit to watch . 
i mean , if you do rent it , and i do n't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minut . 
but i have to put it to seagal for creat a film so bad , that the last film i view with my uncl wa a pleasur one . 
my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock )
