i wish i could accur describ the theme music for part 3 . 
the best way i can put it is that it 's funki . 
i know thi is an odd question , but rememb the open music of `` polic academi 4 : citizen on patrol `` , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the titl song `` citizen on patrol `` dure the open credit ? 
it 's just like that . 
anyway , part 3 take place a day after the event of part 2 ( so technic still 1985 ) . 
thi time , a group of horni teen ( who also bring along two age hippi pothead for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed . 
it turn out that one of the teen had been attack by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between part 1 and 2 ) so whi she ha return to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murder is beyond me . 
she 's the lone survivor thi time . 
part 3 wa origin shown in theater in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it look as though they may have been fairli decent effect . 
jason had long , wild hair when he wa unmask in part 2 . now , one day later he 's complet bald . 
also , it be one day later , it ca n't be friday the 13th now can it ? 
oh well . 
steve miner is the onli director who helm more than one film in the seri .
