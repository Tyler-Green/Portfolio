we 're back in blade runner territori with thi one , conceptu artist robert longo 's vision of a william gibson-inspir futur where inform is the commod to kill for . 
front and center is johnni ( keanu reev ) , a `` cyber-couri `` who smuggl data via a `` wet-wir `` implant . 
he 's readi to quit the biz and get a portion of hi long-term memori restor , but , first , he ha to finish one last , danger job . . 
the press problem in johnni mnemon is that keanu reev seem to have forgotten how to play an action hero sinc hi stint on speed . 
he 's walk wood in a forest of stiff that includ henri rollin , ice-t , and dina meyer . 
( dolph lundgren 's street preacher is in an act categori all it own . 
: - ) without a believ perform between them , all we can do is sit back and watch the atmospher , which is pretti good in place . 
the vr sequenc are way cool , but the physic fx -- such as miniatur and matt -- leav a lot to be desir . 
watch out for those bad blue-screen ! 
we would n't mind a minut of johnni mnemon if the action play better . 
too bad the debut director is n't veri strong in thi de- partment . 
hi big final is a sloppi , silli mess that run twenti minut too long , which is way past the time that most of our `` wet- wire `` processor have alreadi shut down . 
bottom line : yatf ( yet anoth tortur futur ) . 
skip it .
