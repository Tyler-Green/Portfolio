2 day in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off . 
it basic involv how a bunch of quirki charact in the lo angel area end up have their live becom intertwin in some veri unusu way . 
i 'm not go into much greater detail than that , sinc it would take forev to explain , and quit frankli , i 'm not will to spend ani more time on it than the 2 hour that i 've alreadi wast . 
while it tri veri hard to be pulp fiction , 2 day in the valley fall way short . 
thi is quit a condemn consid the cast includ danni aiello , jame spader and jeff daniel . 
while the stori is n't much , and the dialogu and charact rate onli margin better , 2 day in the valley doe have a coupl of bright spot . 
jame spader 's charact , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way . 
and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babe teri hatcher and charliz theron ( in her first role ) . 
you know a movi is n't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women . 
even if they are both gorgeou . 
i will give the writer some credit for the fairli clever way in which they manag to intersect the live of thi group of charact that would have otherwis never interact . 
but marvel at that ingenu is a far cri from actual enjoy the result . 
while some of the charact and their respect stori are fairli interest , they inevit are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the charact that i realli care absolut noth about . 
if i were to put a number on it , onli about half of the stori and half the charact in thi movi were particularli interest or otherwis enjoy to watch . 
thi is the sort of movi that onli a huge fan of one or more of the cast member should rent , and even then prepar for disappoint . 
not even charliz theron be nake would get me to sit through thi movi again . 
or at least not all of it anyway .
