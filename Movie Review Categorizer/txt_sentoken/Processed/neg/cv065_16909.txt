movi review have an oblig to see the good , the bad , and the despic . 
i origin wrote thi review for my colleg newspap back in '95 , but i want to re-writ it becaus not all retro review should be about the classic . 
we need to be warn about some truli aw film , too . 
thi pictur wa so bad , it inspir the descript for my 1/10 rate ( see rate chart below ) . 
the onli thing save it from a 0/10 rate is that be abl to rent a movi like thi is slightli less embarass than rent a porno . 
so , it doe inde have some pluss . . . 
in fair , elizabeth berkley is certainli worth see in the buff . 
and her abil to whine and irrit us , even while nude , wa appropri in her role as selfish temptress nomi malon . 
thi charact is not smart , not interest , and ( deliber ? ) 
far too annoy far too often . 
like in 1998 `` bulworth `` , when the movi wa over i did n't care one littl iota about the main charact . 
at least warren beatti tri to make a statement with hi dreari and overr film , though . 
`` showgirl `` is too stupid to make a statement . 
some peopl claim that the stori is base on the legendari `` all about eve `` of all thing ! 
if exploit expert joe eszterha wa half the screenwrit that joseph l . mankiewicz wa , he 'd be . . . well , 
he 'd be a good screenwrit . 
instead , thi project may have sunk hi career . 
he wrote the ( ha ha ! ) 
script and the usual reliabl paul verhoeven direct . 
the same team who creat a good sex-film in 1992 ( `` basic instinct `` ) struck out here with their occasion violenc , gratuit x-rate sex scene , and numer ( and quit unnecessari ) lesbian overton . 
the predict storylin revolv around nomi streak into la vega to make it big as a dancer . 
after the suppos street-smart young `` ladi `` get con out of her suitcas by a slack-jaw yokel in the open sequenc , she befriend a tailor of the glamor stage product at the `` stardust hotel `` . 
nomi doe n't take advantag of thi contact to break into the big-tim of dirti danc right away . 
first , she becom a lap dancer at a scummi strip club . 
she sell her hot littl ware at `` the cheetah `` for a short time , turn on the fictiti custom and the actual theatr audienc . 
hey , i never said she wa n't a hot number . . . 
mayb it 's that , her bodi , which get her into the big-tim when the star of the `` stardust hotel `` , crystal connor ( gina gershon ) stop into the strip club ( it certainli is n't her brain or pleasant disposit ! ) . 
crystal request a privat lap danc for her boyfriend ( kyle maclachlan ) . 
he also happen to be the pleasure-seek worm who run the big show . 
crystal get nomi onto the `` stardust `` team and , after an intermin amount of time , nomi `` earn `` the role of crystal 's understudi . 
the slut then deliber injur and hospit crystal . 
it wa almost laughabl that nomi had the gut to claim that she 's `` not a whore `` . 
that 's a phrase we hear a few differ time and it 's complet ludicr . 
of cours she is ! 
she sell her soul to make it big , but in the end we 're suppos to believ that she 's a better person than that . 
we 're suppos to root for her . 
no way ! 
she 's a tramp and a back-stabb who deserv noth -- least of all vindic in the . . . ahem . . . climax . 
she is not a good person and they take over two hour to explain that the audienc should think that she is . 
the sub-plot with a male dancer ( glenn plummer ) who claim to see talent in nomi is just a gratuit opportun to let her danc nake a littl bit more . 
it sure ai n't charact develop ! 
plummer also appear in `` speed `` in '94 in a smaller , yet better role . 
thi sub-plot goe absolut nowher except mayb to deliv an unsubtl hint that fornic should practic birth control . 
kyle maclachlan must have been promis a big pay-day or hi standard have dip sinc appear in `` blue velvet `` . 
that pictur wa weird , but some critic claim it 's one of the best movi of the '80 . 
now ol ' kyle can say that he act in one of the worst of the '90 , too . 
hi sleazi charact is import to `` showgirl `` , but we do n't learn anyth about him . 
he use peopl to get what he want , but that onli mean that he fit in well with the other charact in thi movi . 
is he a villain ? 
who care ! 
ultim , thi movi is as tiresom as it is explicit . 
everyon must know by now about the soft-cor act of copul , especi the riotou romp between berkley and maclachlan in hi pool . 
what few review take issu with is how mean-spirit thi movi is . 
everyon 's either have sex , exact reveng , or wish they were have sex or exact reveng . 
it 's just too hard to take ( especi for over two hour ) . 
if we must be expos to the evil of the vega world , whi could n't verhoeven have also made a point of highlight the whisper , grunt , and other sound dure the danc number ? 
it 's hard to care about these peopl if we ca n't even appreci what they 're capabl of do on-stag . 
berkley may have a futur in hollywood becaus she can danc and she ha a great bodi . 
after all , the world of porn is still an activ , dishonour profess . 
perhap berkley could join their rank and leav the real act to pauli shore and cindi crawford . 
oop , they 're bad actor , too . 
well , at least , they 're not selfish and contempt like good ol ' slutti nomi malon . 
useless trivia -- iron , elizabeth berkley play virtuou and `` holier than thou `` jessi on the teeny-bopp tv show , `` save by the bell `` , befor break onto the big screen .
