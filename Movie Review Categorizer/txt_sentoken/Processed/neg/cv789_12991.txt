_dirty_work_ ha a premis of delici mean-spirit potenti . 
mitch weaver ( norm macdonald ) and hi lifelong best friend sam mckenna ( arti lang ) are loser in life : they were constantli pick on in school , and now they can not hold regular job . 
but as the trailer goe , `` there is one thing mitch weaver is good at -- reveng . `` 
so he and sam parlay their unmatch skill in getting-even scheme into a market revenge-for-hir busi call dirti work inc . 
thi should be the groundwork for a wonder wick black comedi , but for a film call _dirty_work_ , what ensu is rather clean of spirit . 
in fact , what make mitch and sam start up their busi is not a giddi desir to give bulli a tast of their own medicin , but rather a more sappi reason : sam 's father ( jack warden ) need a heart transplant , and in order for him to move at the top of the recipi list , hi compuls bet doctor ( chevi chase ) ask the guy for $ 50 , 000 to pay off hi booki . 
so for all the scheme that goe on , beneath everi underhand plot is -- gasp ! -- a 
heart , which undercut the inher nasti of the premis . 
not that there is n't a lot of nasti on display -- there is , but of a differ sort . 
there are frequent sexual refer , most promin in the form of prostitut and sam 's impot father 's ongo lust for them . 
and for a film rate pg-13 , director bob saget ( ye , that bob saget , of _full_house_ and _america's_funniest_home_videos_ fame ) and writer frank sebastiano , fred wolf , and macdonald himself , stretch the boundari of good tast rather far -- arguabl a bit too much so ( wa not one , but two separ instanc of sodomi between anim realli necessari ? ) . 
but the issu , of cours , is not so much of tast as it is humor -- as in , is it funni or not ? 
the answer is a resound no . 
it 's not that macdonald is n't a funni guy . 
he wa one of the more consist funni perform on _saturday_night_live_ befor hi much-talked-about fire , and hi dri brand of smartass wit translat well to the big screen ; it also doe n't hurt that he 's a natur , likabl screen presenc . 
he is abl to give some of hi line a nice acid touch , but , for the most part , the onelin , as written , are flat , and the broad slapstick gag just do n't work ( one run gag ha him be liter toss out of build -- a real riot ) . 
still , macdonald 's few shine moment are just about the onli moment the film ha . 
the late chri farley , as hyster as he ever wa , is amus in a cameo role , but , as a whole , the support player are amateurish and seemingli free from ani directori guidanc . 
saget tri to juic up the proceed with kitschi cameo by gari coleman , adam sandler , and john goodman , but their minim novelti valu can not prevent _dirty_work_ from sputter to the end of it brief 81-minut run time . 
the film close on a sad note of desper , an indulg reel of outtak from which onli those involv in the product would deriv ani amus . 
come to think of it , i can not imagin anyon but those involv in the product to find much amus in the entireti of _dirty_work_ .
