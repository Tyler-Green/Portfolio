you know the plot : a dimwit with a shadi past is seduc into commit a crime onli to be double-cross by a fatal femm . 
in `` palmetto , `` the dimwit is harri barber ( woodi harrelson ) , a report who 's just been releas from prison ( he wa frame by the gangster and corrupt offici he wa investig ) . 
enter la femm : rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the sexi young wife of the richest man in palmetto , florida ( rolf hopp ) . 
she and her stepdaught odett ( chlo ? sevigni ) have a plot to extort 500k from the old man : harri will `` kidnap `` odett . 
after grope both women , harri agre . 
as everyon except harri can see , he 's be set up as a fall guy . 
sure enough , befor long , harri ha a dead bodi in hi trunk and the cop on hi tail . 
hi brother-in-law ( tom wright ) , an assist da , ha hire harri to be the press liaison for the case , so harri get a front row seat for hi own manhunt ( and we get to watch him sweat-liter ) . 
there are sever plot twist , of course-a coupl of them even took me by surpris . 
appar everi woman in palmetto is a rave horndog , and they 're on harri like he 's the onli bone in the kennel . 
shue vamp so broadli that i expect tex averi 's wolf to show up . 
her incred perform in `` leav la vega `` seem to have been a fluke . 
here , she could easili be mistaken for melani griffith . 
shue 's charact is suppos to be a savvi schemer but she come off as a brainless bimbo . 
in addit to shue and sevigni , the kennel includ gina gershon ( who fill the dimwit-with-a-shady-past role in `` bound `` ) as harri 's girlfriend nina ; when harri get out of jail , she lick hi face ( now there 's a horndog ) . 
the part are so overplay that with a littl push `` palmetto `` could have been an over-the-top parodi of film noir a la `` romeo is bleed . `` 
as it is , it 's best watch at 2am on showtim ( the love scene seem to have been written for one of that channel 's soft porn program anyway ) . 
`` palmetto `` ha a well-known director , volker schl ? ndorff , who 's best known for hi adapt of major literari work , especi `` the tin drum . `` 
i suppos he must have been drawn to thi plot-by-numb script by the same admir for classic film noir that led scorses to remak `` cape fear . `` 
schl ? ndorff tri hard-h make an interest motif out of the ubiquit palmetto bugs-but noth can freshen up thi stale script .
