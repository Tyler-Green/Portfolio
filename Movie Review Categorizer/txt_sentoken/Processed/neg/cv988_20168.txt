thi movi is written by the man who is deem to be `` one of the hottest writer in hollywood `` . 
he wrote the groundbreak screenplay for scream ( 8/10 ) , then ad the success i know what you did last summer ( 7 . 5/10 ) 
script to hi mix , and also creat the popular tv seri `` dawson 's creek `` . 
so when he ask to direct hi first movi , base on hi first ever script written , everyon and their grandma said `` sure , go for it ! `` . 
uhhm , my question is . . . did anyon bother read thi stupid script ? ? ? 
plot : ace student leigh ann watson is mistakenli caught with some cheat paper by the bitchiest teacher in the west , mr . tingl , and set to lose her scholarship to colleg . 
when she and her friend visit the teacher at home in order to explain their side of the stori , they end up tie her up , and slowli tri to talk some sens into the hardhead woman . 
critiqu : it 's not so much that thi is a bad movi , than the fact that it suck . 
thi movi is chock-ful of one-dimension charact , contain no actual humor that i wa abl to zone in on , zero tension or thrill , plot hole the size of my big ass , lame pop tune play to mask noth go on in the movi , and molli ringwald , vivica a . fox and lesley ann warren toss away in throwaway role . 
i wa prime for thi film as it interest premis had me think miseri ( 8/10 ) and 9 to 5 , but unfortun for williamson , he went nowher with the bright foundat , make refer to the exorcist and dr . 
zhivago , which i doubt mani in hi target market will appreci . 
he also forgot about suspens , with all of hi charact base on incomprehens decis , unbeliev motiv and simpli bore us with all of their trite dialogu . 
sure , kati holm is cute , and her co-star , marisa coughlan , did a reason amus impress of the exorcist ( worth two point out of my three on ten ) , but how can we forgiv the biggest one-dimension charact in ani film , holm ' rival in the film , mr . tingl 's complet unprofession be let go by all other around her ( are teacher allow to behav that way nowaday ? ) and a transpar romanc between holm and some long-hair dude , hire to be the poor man 's version of skeet ulrich ( who himself is a poor man 's version of johnni depp ! ) . 
all in all , thi movi wa laughabl for me , provid me with no insight into anyth , demonstr williamson 's genuin lack of directori skill alongsid a juvenil script , and provid helen mirren with a great role to chew into , unfortun forget to give her charact ani believ , human or capac to comprehend . 
no hip line , no cheap thrill , just a dull time at the movi theater . 
if you want to see a funni teenag movi , go see detroit rock citi ( 8/10 ) , and thank my drunken , sorri ass in the morn .
