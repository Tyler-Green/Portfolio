read the cast and director for the new mobster comedi , `` analyz thi , `` i ask myself , `` how could thi miss ? `` 
robert de niro ( `` taxi driver , `` `` rage bull `` ) , billi crystal ( `` citi slicker `` ) , lisa kudrow ( `` the opposit of sex `` ) , and director harold rami ( `` nation lampoon 's vacat `` ) . 
these are usual reliabl filmmak ( well , okay , crystal ha been in a sizabl slump late ) , and tellingli , the first half-hour of `` analyz thi `` wa veri funni . 
unfortun , as the run time tick away , i began to think that the first thirti minut had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were be replay anoth two-and-a-half time . 
the film ha obtain a clever premis , but doe not have ani idea what to do with it as it progress becom more and more repetit until i final stop enjoy or care about what wa happen on the screen . 
middle-ag psychoanalyst ben sobel 's ( billi crystal ) life is final go veri well . 
although he ha never gotten along with hi own uncar parent , especi hi father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben ha an easy-go teenag son ( kyle sabihi ) and is about to travel down to miami to get marri to hi tv news report girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) . 
in littl but a flash , howev , ben suddenli see hi plan ruin when he accident hit the car of the mob and subsequ get paid a visit from fame mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desper want counsel , even though he himself wo n't even admit to have anxieti attack . 
ben tri to help paul , mostli so he will get him off hi back , but the plot get more complic when paul follow ben to hi wed , which end with a man drop eight stori to hi death . 
it seem to ben that no matter what he doe , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they becom involv , the more ben 's potenti happi life get into danger . 
`` analyz thi `` ha a few laugh sprinkl throughout ( mostli in the first half ) , but i alway had the nag thought that what director rami and writer peter tolan , rami , and kenneth lonergan had done wa thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightli spoof hi seriou past mafia role , while terror and becom buddi with comic billi crystal ) and then tiresom recycl it for the durat of the 106-minut run time . 
admittedli , de niro is veri funni here ( and i ca n't rememb the last time you could use that adject to describ him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movi is weigh down directli on their shoulder with noth els to support them , includ a substanti plotlin . 
sinc `` analyz thi `` bill not one , not two , but three writer , you 'd think that they would have been abl to work togeth to fix the notic larg flaw , but they must have all been on auto-pilot . 
one of the most disappoint and wast opportun in the film is the way the movi deal with the support charact , all of which have next to noth to do and are n't even given multi-dimension charact to attempt to develop . 
come off of her oscar-calib work in two of last year 's best film , `` clockwatch `` and `` the opposit of sex , `` lisa kudrow 's throwaway `` girlfriend `` role is an incred step down . 
sure , kudrow 's fellow `` friend `` jennif aniston did the same thing two week ago in `` offic space , `` but at least we got to spend a littl time with aniston . 
kudrow , meanwhil , mostli just stand around , no doubt wonder whi she agre to appear in thi film in the first place . 
chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fare even wors , in a role that play more like an afterthought than an actual charact . 
final , molli shannon ( rise film star and cast member on `` saturday night live `` ) ha a rousingli hilari one-scen cameo right at the begin as one of crystal 's patient and then complet disappear . 
too bad , consid that the support actor sure have proven that they have the abil to support de niro and crystal . 
onc `` analyz thi `` approach it second wed scene leav kudrow 's laura stand alon at the altar onc again , i had becom thoroughli annoy by where the stori had gone , and had mostli lost respect for the charact we were suppos to sympath with the most , ben . 
afterward , the climact scene with ben pose as a fellow mob boss in place of the depress paul , becam a real laugh-fre dead-zon , lose it last remain comic punch . 
`` analyz thi `` prove that talent can certainli help ani film out , but when the written materi is n't up to their level , what we are virtual left with is a vacuum of thin air .
