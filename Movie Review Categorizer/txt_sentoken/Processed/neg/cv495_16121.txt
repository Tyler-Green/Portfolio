in the final of disney 's `` mighti joe young , `` a 15-foot tall , 2000-pound gorilla hold a frighten young boy in it clutch as it toppl from a crippl ferri wheel and plummet to the ground . 
upon impact , rug everyman and perenni do-good bill paxton rush in , contain the emot crowd with an earnest `` move along now folk , there 's noth to see here . `` 
ok , so those are n't exactli the word he use , but it 's probabl one of the few clich ? s not utter in thi unnecessari remak of an unnecessari remak of that mother of all monster movi , `` king kong . `` 
1949 's `` mighti joe young `` wa an updat of that classic creatur featur , also base on merian c . cooper 's origin stori ( 16 year after `` 'kong `` it appear the world wa readi for a new take on the beauti and the beast fabl ) . 
now some 49 year later , at least accord to disney 's way of think , the world is readi for one more . 
not so . 
the onli -- and i mean onli -- reason to see the 1998 version is for the special effect . 
and these , unfortun , run hot and cold . 
today 's joe young is design and produc by special-effect whiz rick baker , who ha been wow audienc with hi state-of-the-art make-up effect sinc 1971 's `` schlock `` ( which , incident , featur a baker-enhanc `` gorilla `` ) . 
joe is a combin of animatron effect , comput graphic , and that old standard , a man in a monkey suit . 
while there are occasion flash of brillianc -- baker 's had a lot of practic with simian effect , after all , includ `` gorilla in the mist , `` `` greystok : the legend of tarzan , lord of the ape , `` and the 1976 remak of `` king kong `` -- there 's also some surpris cheesi . 
one of the film 's most embarrass moment is when paxton 's band of african tracker first encount and pursu the larger-than-lif primat ( in a scene unashamedli rip off from `` the lost world : jurass park `` ) . 
paxton jubilantli extol the beast 's majest gait at the same exact moment as joe , and the comput effect drive him , stutter to a halt . 
also , if the film 's produc had want us to focu our attent on the titular ape they should n't have parad femal lead charliz theron ( `` trial & error `` ) around in a seemingly-endless wardrob of spaghetti-strap top . 
even joe seem distract at time . 
the film pile on the clich ? s like there 's no tomorrow , includ the predict plot ( anthro-zoologist ship gigant gorilla to l . a . where urban havoc is inevit wrought ) , predict villain ( a lithuanian i think i overheard someplac ) , predict love stori ( bill and charliz -- surpris ! ) , and predict denouement ( `` 't wa box-offic receipt that kill the beast `` ) . 
kid rais on `` men in black `` ( non-monkey effect also by baker ) are go to find ron ( `` tremor `` ) underwood 's outing a littl lame by comparison . 
while certainli better than 1978 's `` king kong live `` ( itself a lousi sequel to a not particularli good remak ) , `` mighti joe young `` prove how the mighti keep fall .
