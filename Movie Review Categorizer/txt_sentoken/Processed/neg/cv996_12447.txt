john boorman 's `` zardoz `` is a goofi cinemat debacl so fundament misconceiv and laughabl execut that it take on a bizarr enjoy qualiti all it own . 
not sinc the rampant bumbl of one edward d . wood jr . ha a movi been so silli and so seriou at the same time . 
of cours , wood 's career can be explain by two thing : he had no money and he had no talent . 
boorman , on the other hand , can not court such excus to explain `` zardoz `` ( or hi follow-up film , the equal aw `` exorcist ii : the heret `` ) . 
boorman obvious had a sizabl budget , a matine idol movi star ( sean conneri ) in the lead role , and although you would n't know it from thi film , boorman doe inde have talent . 
thi is the man who made the slick modern masterpiec `` deliver `` ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiograph world war ii drama `` hope and glori `` ( 1987 ) , the slightli over-conceiv arthurian epic `` excalibur `` ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungl adventur `` the emerald forest `` ( 1985 ) . 
hi film all show that boorman is never lack in imagin , but sometim that come at the cost of coher and tast . 
if boorman is anyth , he 's ambiti , and when he succe , it 's in grand fashion . 
unfortun , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman fall , the resound impact can be heard for mile around . 
`` zardoz `` is meant to take it place among the grandest of mystic movi , an obsess of boorman 's . 
hi screenplay tri to elicit the same mytholog connot of the arthurian legend or even `` the wizard of oz , `` a book which figur into the movi 's plot . 
but , despit all thi reach , the result movi is more unintent funni than intent enigmat or compel . 
the event take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is littl of the typic futurist movie- to be found . 
in fact , thing seem to have move backward , with peopl ride hors , shoot old-styl gun , and live in larg victorian mansion . 
it 's more middl age than space age . 
the world of `` zardoz `` is divid into two distinct hemispher : the outland , where all the poor , pathet peopl live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthi intellectu live in comfort and everlast life . 
these immort never grow old , they never engag in sexual activ , they possess psycholog power , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist societi where everyon is equal , and everyon contribut equal to the societi . 
howev , if one break the rule , that person is punish by be age so mani year . 
if someon break the rule enough , he or she is age to the point of senil , and imprison to an etern exist in a geriatr home with other age crimin . 
one of the immort , arthur frayn ( niall buggi ) , a squirmi man with a mustach and goate tattoo on hi face , is charg with keep order in the outland and forc the resid to farm so the immort can be fed . 
like `` the wizard of oz , `` he adopt a god-lik statu among the peopl by fli in to their part of the world in a giant stone carv like a menac head . 
( thi fli head is one of the movi 's open imag , and it 's a dead giveaway of the lunaci to come . ) 
call himself zardoz , frayn gather a bunch of outland and make them into a group call the extermin , whose purpos is to kill most of the other outland so they ca n't procreat and take up more resourc . 
from insid hi giant , stone head , zardoz bellow serious laugh-induct statement like , `` the gun is good . 
the peni is evil . `` 
that line alon is worth the movi 's cult follow . 
one day , an extermin name zed ( sean conneri ) , sneak into zardoz 's fli stone , push frayn out , and goe back to the vortex . 
onc there , the immort label him a `` brutal `` and studi him like a lab rat , take great , pervers care in explor hi sexual , which is a mysteri to them . 
they seem especi interest in hi abil to gain an erect , and there is one downright hilari sequenc where a bunch of scantily-clad femal scientist show zed erot footag on a video screen in an attempt to determin what get him work up . 
i say `` hilari `` becaus that is exactli what `` zardoz `` is . 
it is obviou that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made thi film with the straightest of face , although i have a hard time believ that as product move forward , he did n't get even the slightest inkl of how patent ridicul it wa becom . 
just look at conneri is enough to give one the giggl - he spend most of the film run around in a red loin cloth that resembl a diaper , a mane of hair braid halfway down hi back , a wyatt earp-styl handlebar mustach , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boot that would look more appropri on a cheap hollywood hooker . 
boorman made the film right after the critic and financi success of `` deliver , `` which is the onli reason i can imagin a studio would green-light thi effort . 
he attract some rich talent on both side of the camera , includ cinematograph geoffrey unsworth ( `` 2001 `` ) , whose strike visual are about the onli good thing in `` zardoz `` besid the inadvert humor . 
sean conneri had made hi last jame bond film in 1971 , and perhap he wa look for a chang in pace . 
he got exactli that in `` zardoz , `` and it 's a wonder it did n't end hi career . 
i 'm sure boorman intend for thi movi to make some grand statement . 
is it a treatis about the infal of etern life ? 
is it a condemn of those who consid grow old to be a bad thing ? 
or is it a social statement , someth about the inher neg of class distinct and the violenc it creat ? 
karl marx might like it if he were more like timothi leari . 
come to think of it , mayb boorman made it as an extend lsd trip . 
peopl high on illicit substanc are the onli one i can imagin enjoy thi asinin silli as anyth more than a complet unintent comedi .
