okay , bear with me y'all , caus first off i have to get thi off my chest : 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ? 
whew . okay . 
caus that same clip shown over and over again wa begin to get on my nerv toward the end , as cute as the crab mayb . 
even i know that you need more footag than * that * . 
and that wa n't the onli thing get on my nerv . 
the cutesi gimmick , saccharin sweet score / soundtrack and the pretti young face of sarah michel gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flanneri ( as tom ) might have held some appeal dure , oh , say the first 10 minut of the movi . 
at first the movi move along at a quick , interest pace . 
it is speedili establish that someth magic is about to happen to amanda when she encount a total random fairi godfath type person on the street , whose aforement crab follow her everywher and just * doe n't * die . 
a ridicul concept , ye , but at thi point i 'm will to accept it becaus i 'm will to accept that thi is how amanda 's life is chang , how her power are receiv . 
later on , the movi ca n't seem to decid whether these power come from thi fairi godfath or from amanda fall in with tom . 
and thi is whi the clip of the crab were annoy ; they were n't just repetit , they were out of place and unnecessari . 
the plot stumbl along at an uneven speed , sometim dwell too long on a particular develop ( amanda suddenli becom a great chef , her fall in love with tom , etc . ) , sometim move on too quickli for it own good . 
some place the plot just doe n't make sens , sometim it 's way too contriv ( the crab bit , for exampl ) , and sometim too corni ( peach emit dri ice . 
ca n't beat that ) . 
all in all the plot seem fragment , unconnect . 
not romant at all , and onli funni in some place . 
so , okay , do the magic power come from the crab ? 
or the fairi godfath ? 
she can * float * now too ? 
and all of a sudden , instead of just make dri ice come out of peach , she can put her emot into her food ? 
tom all of a sudden just accept amanda 's `` witchcraft `` in the end ? 
would peopl realli dine in a restaur that resembl life after death in tupac 's video ? 
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? 
it is unfortun , becaus i like the basic premis of the movi , until it becam too fantast and tiresom . 
the film seem to skirt around a seriou theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but toward the end it resolv to show us long flashback clip and 5 minut of peopl cri at their tabl . 
the humor wa good in some place ( nolan get the funniest bit , includ that incomprehens , total random thing with the doll ) . 
gellar and flanneri are qualifi actor , and gellar ha a particular charm , but i much prefer her play the sauci buffi ( or even annett in the upcom `` cruel intent `` ) than thi sorri excus for a charact . 
it 's almost funni sometim to see these two tri so hard to make the dialogu sound better than it is , or tri to make the relationship seem more plausibl . 
the support charact nolan wa a highlight , though he remind me a bit of kevin in `` you 've got mail `` ( see footnot ) . 
and , as alway , typic of a chick flick / romant comedi , there 's a seemingli endless romant soundtrack in the background , cu up at all the right place . 
thi sort of got on the nerv after a while , too . 
`` simpli irresist `` is not hard to understand , light , funni in some place , and gener disappoint becaus it ca n't draw the line between romanc and protract sap , between humor and tire slapstick . 
and how could i refrain from make a pun ? 
. 
. 
. 
`` simpli irresist `` is all too easi to resist . 
( first view , 2/6/99 ) 
* did anyon els think thi wa a tad bit similar to `` you 've got mail `` ( or `` the shop around the corner `` ) ? 
busi rival fall in love . 
femal counterpart 's busi is in danger of be shut down . 
femal as mother- like figur guid her . 
the annoy , hyster ex-girlfriend . 
* i _really_ like sarah michel gellar 's wardrob .
