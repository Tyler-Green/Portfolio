i 've never written a review for a movi i have n't watch all the way through , but i had to make an except with powder . 
i wa about forty-f minut into thi one at a friend 's hous when he and hi brother got into a huge shout match that would have end in violenc had we not left the hous . 
so i never got to finish the movi and i 'm sure as hell not go to pay three more buck to watch half of a bad movi . 
but i can at least get a partial review out of it , becaus i saw enough to know thi one wa n't worth finish in the first place . 
the movi center around a freaki teenag who 's spent hi entir life live in the cellar of hi grandpar ' hous . 
when grandpa die ( take hi depart store down with him ) , social worker mari steenburgen ha to take powder ( first and middl name ? 
gold bond ) to a state home , where we find out he 's a differ from the other kid . 
actual , we find out he 's differ when we first see him , becaus he 's the most pale individu we 've ever seen and moreov he ha no bodi hair whatsoev . 
when powder is born in the open minut of the movi , the father take one look at him and say `` he 's not my son . `` 
obvious . 
all i want to know is where the pillsburi dough boy wa nine month ago . 
so the white-fac freak leav hi neverland ranch for the state home and face the ridicul of other kid . 
that is , until they tri to haze him dure hi first cafeteria lunch by make him `` wear `` hi spoon ( `` you can either wear it on your nose or up your ass . `` 
decis , decis . . . ) and he use telepath power to draw all the silverwar in the room into a giant pile in the middl of the tabl . 
so if hi father is the pillsburi dough boy , hi mother must be sissi spacek 's carri charact . 
and you have to factor in two more thing from the subsequ scene , as we find out powder ha some sort of super-intellig ( `` your i . q . 
test went straight off the chart ! `` ) 
and attract electr power . 
thi first show up as powder visit the world of high school ( if he 's such a geniu alreadi , whi would he need a high school educ ? ) and sit through a demonstr in jeff goldblum 's scienc class . 
goldblum plug in a `` jacob 's ladder `` devic that show current run up two wire and immedi the current flow across the room and into powder 's chest . 
but goldblum just stand there for about thirti second watch , instead of just unplug the damn thing . 
i guess he wa too busi contempl whi he wa appear in hi third bad movi in a row ( follow hideaway and nine month ) . 
that 's about all i saw befor the big fight began and , let me tell you , that wa twice as interest as the movi itself . 
but like i said , i saw enough to know thi would be one of those terribl melodrama about the isol of peopl who have superior abil and how hard it is for those peopl to assimil themselv into mainstream civil . 
none of these movi ever handl the subject properli , instead introduc the feebl beauti and the beast copout of have a beauti woman fall in love with the guy 's person , overlook hi person appear . 
i alreadi had the femal charact pick out ( the girl who wa sit next to him in the back of the room dure the electrocut scene ) , but i guess i 'll never know for sure what happen .
