susan granger 's review of `` america 's sweetheart `` ( columbia/soni ) 
what a wast of a talent cast ! 
billi crystal and co-writ peter tolan have concoct a sli , provoc premis and , as the open credit roll , it 's obviou that they 're attempt an old-fashion romant comedi . 
the stori involv a veteran publicist ( billi crystal ) who is summon to orchestr a press junket in la vega when an arrog director ( christoph walken ) hold a megabuck movi hostag in hi edit room , refus to show it to anyon . 
he figur that by give the journalist juici hint of a possibl reconcili between the film 's once-married-but-now-estrang star , gwen and eddi ( catherin zeta-jon , john cusack ) , they 'll be so distract that they wo n't rememb they did n't see the movi or it wa n't what they expect . 
( and crystal thought of thi long befor a soni exec concoct the phoni critic/david man quot scandal ! ) 
for help , he turn to gwen 's person assistant/sist ( julia robert ) . 
but the laugh are few and far-between . 
crystal 's glib , cynic flack is n't wickedli funni enough with a few amus one-lin . 
after six month under the care of a depak chopra-lik guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack 's charact 's too emot fragil , lack the necessari charisma . 
zeta-jon 's vain , narcissist diva is undevelop and one-dimension . 
onli hank azaria , as zeta-jon 's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and robert manag to whip up ani farcic froth . 
basic , we do n't like these ego-driven , stereotyp charact , let alon root for them to unwind their romant entangl , and joe roth 's direct is predict , formula and telegraph . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` america 's sweetheart `` is a contriv , shallow 4 . as a screwbal satir , it 's strictli superfici .
