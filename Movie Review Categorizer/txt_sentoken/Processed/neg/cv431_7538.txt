`` shagadel ! `` , `` groovi , babi ! `` 
`` smash ! `` 
adorn the 1/4 page ad for thi movi tab as `` the # 1 comedi in america `` as of may 8th . 
did we attend the same movi ? ! 
at 87 minut it seem overlong , like a snl skit on steroid , and at ani length it seem unfunni . 
ye , the set and costum were an interest exagger of 60 pop frill , and ye , the concept , deal with a 60 secret agent/pop icon ( play by myer ) awaken from hi cryogen slumber to battl hi arch enemi ( dr . 
evil , also play by myer ) in the present day , had a great deal of potenti . 
fun costum and sceneri and potenti do not a movi make so let throw in a hefti dose of bathroom humor . 
do n't get me wrong , i like a good `` bubbl in the bathtub joke `` as much as the next person , but to have thi type of humor be the funniest thing about your movi is a wast of yuor talent and my money . 
but , the way thing work these day in the movi busi , all a film ha to do is call itself the funniest and peopl will believ it . 
i do give thi film star becaus of the set , costum , and sadli , unmet potenti .
