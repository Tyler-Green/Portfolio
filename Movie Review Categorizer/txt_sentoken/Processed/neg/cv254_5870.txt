even the best comic actor is at the merci of hi or her materi , as thi subpar submarin comedi prove . 
down periscop star kelsey `` frasier `` grammer as an inept navi captain who is given command of hi own ship as part of a corrupt offic 's ( jame coburn ) plan to get him out of the navi . 
like ani lame emsembl comedi , the offic assign him to a group of misfit like the guy who want to be kick out , the fat guy who eat all the time , the beauti woman who doe n't belong there ( lauren holli ) , the second-in-command who doe everyth by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazi old guy who freak everyon out ( harri dean stanton ) and so on . 
then come the transpar plotlin . 
first grammer ha to fix up the delapid korean war ship the navi ha given him , and that come courtesi a sad sight gag montag that includ a guy with a mop knock schneider overboard . 
after the ship is fix up come the earli drill , where everyon seem complet inept , like the electrician who ca n't connect wire so instead let the current run through himself everi time grammer get on the phone . 
final , and thi cover the final hour of the movi , grammer ha to lead hi men ( and holli ) to overcom the other ship in a wargam exercis . 
and he ha to be a clever rebel to do it , in scene that stretch all level of believ . 
first they 're sing `` louie louie `` like a bunch of drunk sailor to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirti minut later , they 're make whale mate nois to throw the radar of the other ship off . 
the whole while , evil captain coburn is overact underwat , curs grammer ( as most peopl watch the movi probabl are too ) . 
it 's all predict without ani origin humor to redeem it . 
the joke are right out of `` mchale 's navi `` and other cut-rat sitcom of the past . 
there 's one scene where schneider look through the ship 's pantri in disgust , hold one food can up and announc , `` thi expir in 1966 ! `` 
i yell back at the screen , `` so did these joke . `` 
i watch thi movi with the whole famili and everyon hate it . 
my mom wa so bore she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i start write my will . 
the blame ca n't realli be place on the star , though . 
kelsey grammer is good in thi , he just doe n't have anyth to work with . 
hi charact is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had `` welcom aboard `` tatoo on hi peni . 
grammer probabl did someth even wors -- got realli drunk and agre to appear in a movi he knew noth about . 
same for holley ( save the peni part ) , who is likeabl in down periscop just becaus she 's so gorgeou . 
as for schneider ( whose charact is downright annoy ) , there wa nowher to go but up after surf ninja , although he 's still in the depth of the comedi ocean after jump the `` snl `` ship . 
my theori is that down periscop is one of those movi that got the green light befor the script wa even written as a formula comedi ( `` okay , it 's polic academi in the navi with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . `` ) and after everyon wa sign on turn into a disast . 
judg from the video box , most other movi critic agre with me . 
the onli quot the down periscop copi writer could dig up came from the prevu channel 's jim ferguson . 
i guess even jeff craig from `` 60 second preview `` ( who said tank girl `` kick butt ! `` 
without ever see it ) did n't like thi .
