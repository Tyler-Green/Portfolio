america 's favorit homicid playth take a wick wife in `` bride of chucki , `` and their unholi matrimoni is someth old , noth new . 
the burn question on the mind of most moviego , howev , ha noth to do with nuptial specif or even how the movi stack up , but rather whether or not the duo get down and dirti on their blood-soak honeymoon . 
the answer is a sick-and-twist ye - and viewer are treat to a shadowi glimps of some hot-enough-to-melt-rubb ( or at least sing it ) lovin ' . 
guess they 're anatom correct . 
chucki ( again voic by brad dourif ) , of cours , is the star of the `` child 's play `` seri , a my buddy-typ doll possess by the spirit of a slain serial killer . 
in `` bride , `` the plot ( heh ) pick up with hi girlfriend tiffani ( jennif tilli ) resurrect chucki 's remain ( he wa blown up at the end of `` child 's play 3 `` ) with the help of a black art manual call `` voodoo for dummi . `` 
silli mortal . 
befor long , she 's also been reduc to shin-high figurin statu , and the plastic incarn of these one-tim lunat lovebird hit the road to scope out some potenti new human bodi . 
the rest of thi rocki horror puppet show play out as tiff and the chuckster stalk a young coupl ( nick stabil and katherin heigl ) with conjug plan of their own , lead them toward a new jersey grave where a magic , soul-transf amulet allegedli lie in wait . 
along the way , our murder barbi and ken go through post-marriag motion similar to ani given pair of newlyw - bicker , argu , kiss and make up . 
but when they squabbl over who 's go to do the dish , watch out . 
hey , even faux peopl have got to work through their problem . 
director ronni yu keep the mayhem flashi and stage an invent scene or two , but not even visual flair can make up for the fact that these creepi kewpi are neither scari nor menac . 
when one of them charg , it 's noth a good forward punt could n't take care of . 
and when a climact chase scene is need , one of the dim-bulb protagonist must _pick_chucky_up_ so the demon toy can forc hi hostag to run at gunpoint . 
throw in some silli casualti and a ridicul end ( will `` son of chucki `` be next ? ) and thi is a bizarr bad 89-minut at the movi . 
as is the thing to do in post- `` scream `` slasher cinema , don mancini 's screenplay slather on the in-jok and genre-parodi . 
but littl of the humor succe , prove self-refer can be complet worthless when it lack bite . 
to be fair , though , most of `` bride of chucki `` is on auto-pilot , so it 's not quit right to singl out one misfir aspect of the film . 
similarli shaki , the act rang from screech camp to bore bland , the effect are n't that special and the stori is one big groaner . 
here 's hope chucki and hi entir clan - past , present and futur - rest in peac .
