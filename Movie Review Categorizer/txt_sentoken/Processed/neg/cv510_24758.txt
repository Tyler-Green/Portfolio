well let see . . . i 'm 
not quit sure how to review thi film , base on it laughter factor . 
well yeah i can , it 's not funni . 
ok so i laugh one time which warrant the 1/2 star , but other than that i sat in my seat wonder when thi po would be over , ( which at a run time of 107 minut seem like forev ! ) . 
in fact , thi could be the un-funniest movi i 've seen in a long time , if not the un-funniest . 
let me be the first to say `` readi to rumbl `` is a huge disappoint . 
long time wrestl lover ( david and scott ) dream of make it to the wcw , and watch jimmi king wrestl . 
that is their hero of cours , whom is kick out of the wcw . 
well here is where the plot thicken ( lol ) : the two wish to rescu the king , and put him back into the wcw but not that easili , becaus they are be tamper with by mani peopl who are out to get them , while david 's father want him to becom a polic offic , and scott is a loser who ha to with the help of david clean out johnni on the spot . 
what a plot eh ? 
`` readi to rumbl `` is one of those film that tri to be funni , but sadli fail miser , everyth in the film is imcomprehins , and even the trailer wa n't funni . 
the actor are dull , the script aw , and the plot which there is n't much of . . . . realli 
annoy . 
i 'm not quit sure how great actor like these , and veri funni actor too , are given such a lame script , and direct in such a childish manner , that i wonder if hollywood is ever gon na make good film these day . 
thi review is n't go to be veri long becaus of the fact that there is n't much go for the film , if anyth at all . 
onli one big laugh is in the film , which is n't all that hilari . 
i sat in my chair wonder with thi 107 ( ! ! ! ! ! ) 
minut `` comedi `` wa go to be over , and sadli it went on forev . 
i 'm not sure if anyth could have save thi film from be such a total wast , but believ me you , it is .
