synopsi : when a meteorit crashland in the arizona desert , commun colleg professor ira kane ( duchovni ) and harri block ( jone ) are first on the scene . 
they discov that an alien lifeform ha arisen from the rock and is evolv at an amaz rate . 
soon the armi , advis by dr allison reed ( moor ) , move in and forc kane and block out . 
but when the alien begin to menac societi , it may take the scientist ' combin effort to stop them befor they termin the evolut of anoth lifeform : human . 
review : `` evolut `` certainli ha the ingredi for a decent comedi . 
it 's direct by reitman , clearli tri to parlay hi `` ghostbust `` success into a twenty-first-centuri counterpart . 
it star duchovni , and although one might question hi judgment in lampoon hi `` x-file `` charact so soon after leav the tv seri , it should certainli provid him with plenti of ammunit . 
and then there 's moor , who may not have much prior experi in comedi , but who ha certainli proven her abil as an actress . 
a shame , then , that it all deterior into such a hopelessli unfunni morass . 
`` evolut `` is a movi more concern with it special effect ( which are quit good ) than anyth resembl a consist funni script . 
it ha it moment ( a scene in which jone ' bodi is invad by an alien is particularli entertain ) , but there are embarrassingli long stretch that are utterli devoid of humour . 
moor is total wast , her clumsi shtick get veri old , veri fast . 
duchovni ha stunningli littl in the way of materi to work with . 
and the stori is so formula , it could have been written by monkey . 
part of what made `` ghostbust `` so wonder wa a combin of a great script and charact the audienc could root for . 
`` evolut `` is so mind-numbingli tediou that it 's difficult not to start cheer for the alien .
