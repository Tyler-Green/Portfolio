what hath kevin williamson wrought ? 
while the horror movi reviv spur on by hi _scream_ ha yield a few decent entri in the genr -- _i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ -- it must be note that williamson himself had a hand in the write of those film . 
those williamson-less post-_scream_ effort , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frighten all right -- frighteningli , insultingli _bad_ . 
add to that list _urban_legend_ , which take a promis premis and run it through a predict meat grinder of idioci . 
the influenc of williamson on screenwrit silvio horta is clear in two key area . 
first , the open sequenc , like that of _scream_ , is an extend set piec detail the singular murder that get the proverbi ball roll . 
thi sequenc , in which pendleton colleg co michel mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapit while drive , also reveal the other obvious williamson-esqu touch : the killer 's look . 
dress in a larg hood parka , wield an axe , the killer bear more than a pass resembl to the _i_know . . . _fisherman , 
san the hook . 
one thing horta doe not borrow from williamson , howev , is the intrigu premis . 
student at pendleton are be kill by way of urban legend -- those contemporari bit of `` mytholog `` pass from person to person , group to group , year to year that becom so embed in the social conscious . 
it hardli matter if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commerci die from a fatal combin of pop rock and pepsi ( he did n't ) . 
michel , slain by the `` killer lurk in the backseat `` of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the bodi count rise , fellow pendleton student natali ( alicia witt ) suspect not onli a link between the murder , but a person link to her past as well . 
the setup show promis , but the stori never take off , due in larg part to horta and the director , the aptli name jami blank , who fire round afer round of hi namesak in term of suspens and scare . 
too mani of the would-b shock are fakeout reliant on bombast music cue , and the film 's chase scene are riddl with the clich that _scream_ tri to subvert , like scream damsel knowingli run themselv into dead end when they should -- and could -- run out the front door . 
but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it come to clich ; there 's also the climact villain confess , in which a contriv and way-too-conveni motiv is reveal , not to mention the credit card open up the lock door trick , which is a clich in ani film genr . 
bank and horta 's ( intent ) attempt at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gag are lazi , in-jokey refer to the other credit of co-star joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart say a lot about the imagin of their humor . 
some laugh are also had when the rather predict ident of the killer is reveal , but i 'm not so sure if some of the more hilari thing about it were meant to be so . 
the filmmak do n't get much help from their onscreen talent . 
i wa far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _ 
starlet jennif love hewitt , but i 'd talk her ani day ove the dread stiff and uncharismat witt , whose inept attempt at emot were often met with laughter ; witt ha a pefect foil in her equal pesence-challeng lead man , jare leto . 
_dawson's_creek_ star jackson mug hi way thorugh a glorifi cameo ; gayheart display all the depth and rang of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lend the film littl more than hi freddi krueger pedigre as a folklor professor . 
grant , the cast is hamper by their materi . 
loretta devin , who ha done some fine work in film such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddl with the ridicul role of a pam grier-worship campu secur guard . 
the recent resuscit horror genr can not reli on the effort one man -- name , kevin williamson -- to stay aliv . 
if other filmmak continu to make such shoddi product as _urban_legend_ , the genr look to onc again go the way of screen slasher ' mani victim .
