susan granger 's review of `` the musket `` ( univers pictur ) 
hollywood launch anoth assault on classic literatur with thi $ 50 million adapt of alexandr duma 's novel that 's strong on action but weak on drama , fuse hong kong martial art with 17th centuri swordplay . 
the stori chronicl the adventur of the dash d'artagnan ( justin chamber ) as he leav hi villag of gascogn , head for pari , to join king loui xiii 's elit guard , the royal musket , and to search for the man who kill hi parent 14 year earlier . 
thi put him in conflict with the formid febr ( tim roth ) , viciou henchman for conniv cardin richelieu ( stephen rea ) . 
the tradit musket trio - arami ( nick moran ) , atho ( jan gregor kremp ) and portho ( steve speir ) - do n't offer much help so he turn to the feisti francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of franc ( catherin deneuv ) . 
scripter gene quintano and director-cinematograph peter hyam are primarili interest in the derring-do , as evidenc by choreograph xin-xin xiong 's elabor - but not origin - stunt , includ a fast-pac stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on roll barrel , high-wir acrobat with the combat dangl from rope , and a ladder-fight sequenc . 
film in southern franc , the sceneri , set and costum are spectacular , but the light is too dark and edit is fill with choppi , restless mtv'ish cut . 
as the swashbuckl d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chamber buckl where he should be swash , total lack on-screen charisma , not to mention act skill . 
mena suvari , so impress in `` american beauti , `` seem like a contemporari interlop in the royal court . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` the musket `` is a cinemat but shallow 3 . 
`` all for one and one for all `` ? 
not thi time 'round .
