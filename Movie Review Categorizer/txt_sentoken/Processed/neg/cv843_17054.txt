star kiefer sutherland ; rees witherspoon & bokeem woodbin i use to think that the convers wa the wors film i had ever seen . 
freeway is give me second thought . 
freeway is a modern retel of littl red ride hood . 
onli in the nineti , littl red ride hood is a foul-mouth juvenil delinqu play by rees witherspoon , and the big bad wolf is a serial killer ( keifer sutherland ) . 
to top that pathet premis off -- rees goe to visit granni and you 'll never guess who 's wait under the cover 's in granni 's bed . 
keifer sutherland is one of hollywood most talent , yet underr actor , and rees witherspoon is except talent and will most like becom a major star . 
so what are they do in thi movi ? 
after see the end result , undoubtedli they are both ask themselv the same question . 
you might be ask yourself whi thi is such a short review . 
the answer is quit simpl -- i dont want to wast ani more of my time write or think about thi movi than absolut necessari . 
i wast enough of my time just sit through it . 
note to keifer : you wonder whi you are n't a bigger star in hollywood ? 
becaus you keep make movi like thi . 
note to rees : you were great in fear , what happen thi time ? 
note to both : do n't worri about it too much , no one saw thi movi anyway . 
bottom line -- i 'm still shake my head . 
do n't wast your time on thi turkey . 
if you want to see a great keifer sutherland movi , go rent flatlin or young gun . 
rees witherspoon 's abund act talent are use to their full potenti in fear , a great thriller . 
do yourself a favor and rent one of these movi -- but stay as far away from freeway as you possibl can .
