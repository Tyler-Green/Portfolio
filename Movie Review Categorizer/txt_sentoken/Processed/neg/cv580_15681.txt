after the recent anim debacl of , `` a rugrat movi , `` and `` a bug 's life , `` i am serious consid rais my highli neg rate on dreamwork ' other insect film from octob , `` antz . `` 
i hate that movi , and yet , it is so much better than these latest two excurs . 
`` a bug 's life , `` is the second anim insect film in the last two month , and i hope for the best , consid it wa done in the wonder style of pixar 's last film , 1995 's `` toy stori , `` but in no way doe , `` a bug 's life , `` even remot match up to that . 
flik ( david foley ) , an ant , who along with hi mani comrad , ha the job everi year of gather up the season harvest , onli to have to give half of it away to the domin grasshopp , led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) . 
flik , howev , feel all alon and unwant in the world , especi after he accident lose all of their food , and the ant are threat by hopper to gather up a whole other season 's load by the time the last summer leaf fall from the tree . 
banish from ant island , flik leav the coloni in search of some strong reinforc to help out , but through a misunderstand , return with a hand of helpless circu bug , includ a walk stick ( david hyde pierc ) , a dung beetl ( brad garrett ) , a gypsi moth ( madelin kahn ) , a male ladybug ( deni leari ) , and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) . 
`` a bug 's life , `` ha one thing go for it . 
onli one thing . 
with it gloriou , bright color , the computer-gener anim is a spectacl to look at . 
the film itself , unfortun , is a lifeless , unamus contrapt without ani of the flair or excit of , `` toy stori . `` 
the charact in , `` a bug 's life , `` are an assort of either unlik or dull insect without ani charm or person , other than to stand around and recit arbitrari and thoroughli unfunni one-lin . 
the thin stori wa also stretch out to a nearli unbear 94 minut , and it often felt as if they ran out of idea throughout , and so they made up pointless scene to pass as time-fil . 
after give such scath review to the anim film from thi year , i wa begin to think that i had simpli outgrown them , but then i realiz thi is just not so . 
i still ador almost all of the older disney film , and mani of the newer one , such as 1989 's , `` the littl mermaid , `` 1991 's , `` beauti and the beast , `` 1993 's , `` the nightmar befor christma , `` and ye , 1995 's , `` toy stori . `` 
mayb thi ha just been a bad year for children 's film , and hope , the upcom , `` the princ of egypt , `` will not be a disappoint . 
as for , `` a bug 's life , `` i did not enjoy anyth about it . 
not the stori , not the charact , and not even the voiceov work , which wa far more live in , `` antz . `` 
`` a bug 's life , `` goe down as yet anoth failur for disney , and it is a sad state of affair when their best film in the last two year ha been the minor jonathan taylor thoma pictur , `` i 'll be home for christma . ``
