call `` hush `` `` stop or my mom will kill . `` 
or `` mommi fearest . `` 
or `` the hand that rob the cradl . `` 
call it whatev you want , but certainli do n't see it unless you 're in desper need of a bad movie-induc chuckl -- `` hush `` score so mani unintent guffaw that it almost qualifi as a guilti pleasur . 
chalk it loss up to frequent stupid laps and appar post-product tinker ( it wa suppos to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appear to have given `` hush `` a send-off that 's downright infuri . 
it 's too bad that `` hush `` is so laughabl , becaus the on-screen talent -- includ the pair of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lang -- is noth to laugh at . 
paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogen new york coupl on their way to spend christma vacat at hi wealthi , well-to-do famili 's hors farm/est kilronan . 
jackson 's mother martha ( lang ) run kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospit make helen feel welcom immedi -- even if her first meet with martha take place while helen is in the altogeth , caught red-hand after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-b . 
but it seem that martha 's friendli smile mask a much more threaten demeanor ; she 's what you 'd call someon who love too much . 
martha eagerli , devious want a grandchild , and then helen will be expend , as far as she 's concern . 
if there 's one reason to catch `` hush , `` it 's lang . 
she treat the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserv to be treat , inject martha ( poorli written though she may be ) with a littl empathi to level out the psycho-play field . 
when she delv into martha 's dark side , predict clich -- chain-smok , stare in mirror , pray in a confession to a priest who is n't there , poke a hole in helen 's diaphragm so she 'll becom pregnant ( and she doe ) -- abound , but it 's moder entertain junk becaus lang is such an interest actress to watch . 
veteran perform nina foch is smart and tart as jackson 's wheelchair-bound patern grandmoth . 
the rest of the cast look ill and uncomfort , especi paltrow . 
but can you realli blame them ? 
the charact relationship in `` hush `` hold a certain amount of promis , at least until their psycholog impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupid . 
idiot situat ( martha yell at a nearbi hors so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiot dialogu ( `` whi did you yell ? `` 
helen yell back at martha ) , and the film take the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hel flick ever made . 
you can see through a great deal of martha 's action and lie from their concept ; whi do peopl who have known thi woman for year longer than we have never figur thing out ? 
doe nobodi commun or read the newspap in thi town ? 
if ani of her potenti victim thought , act or behav like normal peopl , `` hush `` would be a realli short movi . 
and then there 's the climax and end , which abruptli come when helen start have contract after eat some pound cake spike with a labor-induc drug normal use on hors . 
after a realli weird chase scene , martha calmli knit in a rock chair while forc helen to give birth in a bed all by herself . 
i wo n't spoil what happen next except to say that it 's contradictori , illog and ( probabl , sinc i 'm no doctor ) medic imposs . 
the final scene offer no closur , no resolut , no confront whatsoev . 
it 's just there , dangl amidst silent displeasur . 
no one should like thi end , regardless of their feel on the preced materi . 
perhap `` hush `` 's titl is a plea to silenc it audienc 's like bitter word of mouth while exit the theater .
