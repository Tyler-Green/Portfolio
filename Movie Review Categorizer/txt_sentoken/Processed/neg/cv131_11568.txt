about an hour or so into `` the jackal , `` a charact wander around as peopl were be shot at in a big suspens sequenc , and one of the audienc member in the theatr i saw it in shout out `` i hope she get kill now ! `` 
at that point it hit me : i did n't care for ani of the charact be play by actor i did n't realli like . 
when the sole reason you care about a charact be play by sidney poitier in a suspens film is becaus he 's be play by sidney poitier , you know someth 's rotten in the state of denmark . 
everi year , a coupl film like thi are releas . 
you know : the cheap , action pack intern espionnag film , featur a semi-promis premis , some big-nam actor ( usual bruce willi ) , and the hope that some audienc member will forget the cold war end sever year ago . 
thi wa the third one of '97 , follow the veri lacklust `` the saint , `` which featur an amor costum chang bond wannab ; and the surprisingli fun `` the peacemak , `` featur clooney and kidman tri to stop an almost untrac villain . 
`` the jackal `` tri to mix both element . 
and you thought `` the saint `` wa bad . 
`` the jackal `` is loos ( veri loos , i hope ) base on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i 've yet to see , `` the day of the jackal , `` which featur ( appar ) a suav hitman call the jackal , play by edward fox , tri to assasin charl degaul . 
well , welcom to the 90 , where a sorta suav hitman , also call the jackal ( bruce willi ) , tri to kill the head of the fbi . . . or 
is he ? 
after be hire by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeanc for the murder of hi brother ( kill in the open scene ) , the jackal romp all over the northen hemispher , from helsinki to virginia , set up an elabor scheme wherein he 'll be abl to assasin thi person and still get away to live in seclus . 
and like the saint , the jackal chang hi look over and over and over again to elud peopl . 
the agent work on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - ye , that sidney poitier ) , work with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( dian venora - ladi capulet from `` romeo + juliet `` ) , give up earli on and meet with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , put up some tight competit between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who 's in a massachusett jail , but who ha appar seen the jackal , who ha been elud the law forev . 
soon , he 's out work with the two untrust agent , and tri to help them catch him . 
there are numer problem with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretti imposs to put a finger on . 
the film is suppos to be a big suspens thriller , but save a coupl moment , the film never achiev suspens , or even a sens of intrigu . 
sure , the big assasin attempt is a bit cool look and even slightli tens , but everi other scene in the film is too short and too dull to regist . 
the film never pick up enough to becom a thrill experi , or even an entertain one . 
it doe n't help that the plot is design to be complex , but fall into so mani problem , like plot hole and unbeliev circumst . 
the script of `` the jackal `` is a complet mess , mostli becaus it ca n't decid what it want to focu on . 
is thi a film about a man tri to find redempt by catch a nasti killer ? 
is it a film about a nasti , amor hitman who 's in everyth for the money ? 
or is it a combin of both ? 
`` the jackal `` aim for the latter , but never focus in on either charact . 
the connect between the two feel complet edit , so much that in a scene when the jackal turn around and notic declan , you wonder how he recogn him so fast . 
the worst part is the littl past they tri to give declan , most notabl hi relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so littl screen time that you almost forget her charact exist until she pop up everi now and then . 
the support charact are wors . 
sidney poitier is given a complet unplay role , that of a man who is just stern sometim , and other time more give and likabl . 
what is poitier do here ? 
he 's one of the best live actor ! 
doe he realli need to wast hi time do drivel like thi ? 
dian venora 's russian charact is almost as bad , with a cigarett perpetu in her mouth , and a plaster on expressionless facad . 
it 's not that anyon 's bad here ; it 's that they have noth to do . 
the plot is a joke , feel like it wa past togeth by someon in post-product who drop each scene on the floor and past them togeth quickli so it could be releas on time . 
the jackal himself is not even much of an intern villain . 
there are sever time where he 's in a tight situat and make thing wors for himself , the onli explan be that the filmmak want to toss in a cheap thrill . 
take a scene where he 's be follow by some agent into a park garag : he quickli spray hi car anoth color , and add a solvent that if touch kill the person who touch it . 
doe n't kill someon attract more attent than it doe distract ? 
and doe he think die hi hair bottl blond make him fit in in a public place ? 
geez ! 
is there anyth good here ? 
well . . . a 
coupl thing . 
i did like willi 's ici express ; he may not have been real suav or anyth , but some of hi look are worth a chuckl . 
richard gere ha a coupl of good moment , make hi charact as likabl as he possibl could have . 
and a coupl sequenc are kicki in that kind of proposter , complet inan but fun kinda way , most notabl : a sequenc where he test out a new gun on an annoy gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduc a gay washington man , which ha it share of a coupl good joke , most particular a kiss by willi . 
but none of these elev the film ani higher than it could go ; they 're just littl distract along the way to amus us mildli then toss us back into the world of dull and stupid that is `` the jackal . `` 
director michael caton-jon ( who direct the far superior `` rob roy `` ) ha made a film that is made veri coupl month , one that is unentertain , unintrigu , and pretti much cold , but will nevertheless make money becaus , hey , the trailer do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-cl kinda way . 
everi now and then , the filmmak get it right ( `` clear and present danger , `` which wa enorm fun in that smart kinda way ) , but `` the jackal `` is an exampl of when they go complet wrong .
