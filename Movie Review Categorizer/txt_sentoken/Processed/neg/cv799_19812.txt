* * * be warn . . . 
the follow review contain some harsh languag * * * 
the blair witch project . 
quit possibl the least scariest movi of all time . 
if you want to see real terror on the big screen go back and watch ani scene with jar jar bink in the phantom menac , becaus thi movi is not scari or even remot creepi . 
my colleagu and friend chuck dowl wrote that if less is more , then the blair witch filmmak must have thought that noth is more . 
and thi work for him . 
well , i 'm sorri , but noth . . . 
is noth ! ! ! ! ! 
noth is not more . 
it 's nothiiiiiinggggggggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! . 
i do not pay 5 dollar to see noth . 
`` noth `` is free , avail all around the world at a locat near you . 
i am absolut in amaz that some peopl find thi movi scari . 
i could just discount them and say , `` well , i guess they are just pansi chicken shit who are probabl scare of their own shadow . `` 
but i have intellig friend who like thi movi and so that doe n't hold water . 
there must be some other reason . 
( then again , mayb my first thought is correct , i think i 'll tri point their shadow out to them one day and test their reaction . ) 
when i hear peopl prais thi film , i never hear them talk about what make up about 97 % of thi movi : three kid bicker with each other about be lost . 
they onli talk about what might make up possibl 3 to 4 minut of screen time . 
thi be a few veri short night scene where the kid hear some unscari sound and anoth where they shout `` josh ! ! `` 
over and over . 
thi film should not be call the blair witch project , it should more accur be call three dumb and pisspoor filmmak get lost . . . 
and argu with each other . 
oh ladi and gentlemen you will be so scare when you hear them shout `` josh ! ! `` . 
and if you thought that wa scari , wait till you see a pile of rock , and then some tinkertoy lincoln log , oh my dear lord you will be piss in your pant with fear . 
oh yeah , and some goo on one of their backpack . 
you 've never seen terror like thi folk , and you do n't want to . 
the chevi chase/goldi hawn comedi foul play is creepier than thi film . 
( for current film , i highli recommend the sixth sens or a stir of echo for a creepi filmgo experi . ) 
thi film is an exampl of market with no substanc . 
the market wa brilliant , and the whole nation is in awe of just the premis for the film . 
they want thi film to be good . 
and i think they are reach and prais the wrong movi becaus they do n't have anyth els to prais . 
that wonder film that rejuven the horror genr may come along , but thi is not it . 
thi film could have been so much better . 
just think , if mayb there had been onli 10 minut of argu about be lost , and 80 minut of nighttim stuff . 
i saw thi movi with a girl who wa extrem pump for it . 
she wa sold on thi film . 
and then , at one point dure it , she turn to me and ask ' . . . are 
we suppos to be scare by thi ? ' . 
i 've heard one opinion that you `` have to use your imagin `` to creat the fear in thi movi . 
well , i thought that wa what the filmmak were suppos to do . 
use their imagin and creat a good movi . 
i mean anyon can use their imagin and not pay 5 buck for it . 
but even if you like thi idea , then what are you imagin ? 
an entiti call the blair witch ? 
some redneck fuck with these kid ? 
are either of these thing realli scari when you think about it ? ? ? 
i 've heard sever peopl say that thi movi make them recal how scari it can be to be out in the wood and hear someth . 
well sure that scari in real life , but there are a lot of thing that are scari in real life that are not scari in a movi nor even interest . 
you could sit in your hous and see a snake or a spider and it could be scari , but in a film it would n't be . 
and no , a movi doe not need a big budget or cgi special effect to be scari or creepi . 
actual the less the better ( see the equal aw remak of the haunt ) . 
but you have to do someth . 
you cant just count on us all have nostalg memori of how someth like thi could be scari , if it were real . 
and by the way , about the shakycam film in blair witch . 
are n't these suppos to be `` filmmak `` who should know how to point a camera and shoot someth without shake the camera constantli ? 
i 'm not even talk about the coupl scene where they are terrifi , that 's justifi . 
i 'm talk about the other 87 minut of the movi where they ca n't seem to shoot anyth smoothli at all . 
minor quibbl there . 
there is a feel in me that the peopl that like thi movi are sucker . 
that the filmmak are just laugh their ass off all the way to the bank . 
and i think there is a good chanc they will see thi film again and say to themselv `` what wa i think ? ? `` . 
but , if they do n't , then that fine . 
if it work for them then that 's okay i guess . 
i just lament that by make thi movi a hit , we are go to be subject to more of the `` noth is more `` approach . 
pretti soon we 're go to get some movi like thi : just a still shot of a prison jail cell . 
for 90 minut . 
and we 'll have to use our imagin and think to ourselv , `` my god , would n't it be scari to spend life in prison ? ! ! 
thi movi is the scariest movi of all time ! ! ! ! ! `` . 
or , a shot of a coffin , with some funer director argu with each other . 
`` man , do you know how scari it would be to die ? ? ? ! ! ! ! 
now thi is the scariest movi of all time ! ! ! ! ``
