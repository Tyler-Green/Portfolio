john carpent make b-movi . 
alway ha ( `` halloween , `` `` escap from new york , `` `` the thing `` ) and , by the look of it ( `` they live , `` `` escap from l . a . , `` `` vampir `` ) , alway will . 
carpent 's latest horror opu with a scienc fiction bent ( or scienc fiction outing with a schlock horror bent ) is the aptly-titl `` john carpent 's ghost of mar `` ( in case , i suppos , you went look for someon els 's `` ghost of mar `` ) . 
like all those film prefix by the veri possess `` john carpent 's , `` `` ghost of mar `` is an unasham b-movi punctuat by a b-movi plot , b-movi actor , and b-movi special effect . 
in categori one , abov , we have a storylin that border on idiot ( and , at time , chaotic ) . 
dormant martian ( i . e . , swirl red gase ) awaken by meddl human possess the soul of hapless mine colonist render them testi marilyn manson lookalik . 
all thi explain ( in flashback ) to some grand pooh-bah counsel by martian polic offici melani ballard ( natasha henstridg , from the sub- `` speci `` film ) , the onli returne on a silly-look train . 
offic ballard went in to bring back incarcer felon jame `` desol `` william ; what she found wa not a pretti pictur . 
in the second categori we have ms . henstridg , her blond hair pull back tightli and awkwardli into a ponytail , ice cube ( as the appropriately-nam `` desol `` ) , pam grier ( briefli , oddli -- who want to work with whom i wonder ? ) , and a host of extra all assum that the stori and special effect were go to carri thi film and therefor they did n't need to tri too hard . 
in categori number three we have , in addit to those swirl red gase and the silly-look train , a coupl of bird's-eye-view shot of a sprawl martian metropoli ( reddish also ) . 
state-of-the-art special effect have never been a carpent trademark and onc again the writer/director ( who seem to have no problem find work , howev ) doe n't wast ani of the film 's budget in that depart . 
`` ghost of mar `` is lock , laugh stock , and barrel all your standard carpent fare : dingi interior , clutter exterior , inan dialogu , lot of leather , scar , crazed-look alien , and lot and lot of weaponri . 
the film often and alway explod into warfar without warn -- spontan , stupidli . 
carpent might like to think he 's made a western here but it 's a western without ani real hero , villain , or border conflict . 
it 's just the shootout minu a hiss snake plissken . 
i never thought i 'd miss the guy but i do . 
it 's not * all * the same , howev . 
dub the `` one-not wonder `` for hi minimalist music soundtrack , carpent seem to have graduat from simplist ( yet effect ) score by highlight hi action with loud , screech guitar work . 
fortun thi drown out a lot of the dialogu . 
the final exchang between henstridg and , er , cube though is both audibl * and * priceless . 
mar ha proven an infertil breed ground for hollywood in the last year or so , what with the stillborn `` mission to mar `` and `` red planet `` ( with val kilmer ) . 
`` ghost of mar `` sadli add to those disappoint return ( in it open weekend it wa overshadow by a bunch of sequel , among them `` american pie 2 `` and `` rush hour 2 `` ) . 
the ironi is that the mar in carpent 's film feel sadli absent . 
there are occasion refer to the red planet , of cours , but the film might as well have been set in perth amboy than on earth 's closest neighbor . 
two thing keep `` john carpent 's ghost of mar `` from get a huge slap upsid the head . 
1 . 
henstridg keep her top on ( miracul ) , and 2 . the film doe n't pretend to be anyth it 's not . 
what that mean , howev , is that fan of superior , intellig , grade a sci-fi/horror are singularli out of luck .
