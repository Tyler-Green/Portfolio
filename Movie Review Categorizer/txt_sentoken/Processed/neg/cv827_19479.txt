the best thing about , `` lake placid `` is that it 's onli 80 minut long and when it 's over you 're glad that you did n't wast more than an hour and a half of your time . 
it 's noth more than a bad rip-off of , `` jaw `` ( and i think that 's be kind . ) 
it wa written by david e . kelli ( `` alli mcbeal `` ) as a horror-comedi but fail at both , miser . 
i wa never scare and i think that i onli laugh onc . 
the crocodil even fail in comparison to the snake in , `` anaconda . `` 
the plot begin when a man is eaten in half by the giant crocodil in black lake in main . 
that bring the local sheriff ( brendan gleeson ) and a fish-and-gam warden ( bill pulman ) to investig . 
also , a paleontologist ( bridget fonda ) from new york is sent to look at a tooth and an eccentr millionaire/crocodil lover ( oliv platt ) fli in becaus he want to swim besid the beast . 
soon there is tension between everybodi becaus half the peopl want to kill the croc and the other half want to save it . 
there 's also an eccentr old ladi ( betti white ) who live by the lake and ha a few secret . 
as i mention befor kelley and director steve minor ( h20 ) do n't go for a seriou approach toward the materi but they also do n't have anyth sli or satir or witti to say either . 
the betti white charact is complet unfunni and none of the other charact are realli that interest , they 're all basic idiot . 
if they had ani brain the croc would n't have been that much of a challeng to catch and they would n't have put themselv in half of the situat that they did . 
but then again , if they were smart there would n't be a movi . 
basic , `` lake placid `` is best undiscov .
