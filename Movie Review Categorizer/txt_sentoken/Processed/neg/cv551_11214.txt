kate ( jennif aniston ) is have some problem . 
it appear the twenty-eight year old is not happi with her slow progress up the compani ladder , and her love life appar leav someth to be desir . 
she learn that her problem are relat , as the owner of her advertis agenc , mr . mercer ( kevin dunn ) , explain to her that her singl statu doe not bode well with the compani . 
her freedom would make her more like to leav the compani , take client with her . 
a solut present itself in nick ( jay mohr ) , a wed videograph who kate meet through a coincid and get photograph with . 
kate 's boss , darci ( illeana dougla ) , use the photograph to fabric a wed engag between kate and nick . 
kate is at first repuls by the idea , but after get immedi posit result , she pursu it . 
her first task is to convinc nick to go along with her plan . 
the actual plan consist of nick pretend to be her fianc ? . 
at a dinner with kate 's boss he will provok a fight and they will break up . 
she meet nick to propos the plan . 
he accept . 
kate 's new statu bring unexpect result in other area . 
the offic bad boy , sam ( kevin bacon ) , who would n't give kate the time of day , now doe . 
now that she is engag , he pursu an affair with her , as do so would destroy her good girl imag , henc sam 's sudden interest . 
thing start to fall apart for kate , as it becom appar that nick realli like her , and doe not wish to break up with her . 
after some provok nick doe oblig , but problem continu for kate . 
it appear sam is no longer interest now that she is avail . 
or mayb kate doe like nick , but `` reconcili `` will forc her to admit her lie to her employ . 
ad to her mess is the constant pri of her mother ( olympia dukaki ) , who want her to get marri and settl down . 
there is a scene in thi movi where jennif aniston is ( from the waist up ) onli wear a bra . 
it made me chuckl becaus it is the onli time in the movi when she actual wear one . 
there is enough cleavag in thi movi to satisfi russ meyer . 
it 's like the director said 'well , we know the stori is formula and the perform are n't that great so , what the heck , let 's show jennif 's asset as often and as uncov as humanli possibl to keep the pg rate . `` 
quit frankli it 's insult . 
i do n't think aniston is a compet enough actress to carri a movi . 
she did a decent enough job in ed burn ' `` she 's the one `` becaus it wa a smaller and support role , and she just doe n't deliv the good effect in thi movi . 
her perform wa not convinc . 
unfortun , as far as romant comedi go , thi movi add noth new to the standard formula for these type of movi . 
the film is similar to `` my best friend wed `` in a sens that the lead femal charact is actual quit vindict and due her action , get no sympathi from me when thing go awri . 
i did n't care for how quickli kate put down nick 's profess by explain that videotap wed wa n't glamor enough for her co-work . 
at least `` my best friend wed `` chang the formula a bit and had a somewhat surpris end . 
no such luck with `` pictur perfect `` . 
everi plot occurr can be spot a mile away , includ a coupl that realli made no sens . 
after everyth kate had done to prove her loyalti to her compani , whi would she blindli throw it all away when she should have made sure that nick would even talk to her first , let alon consid a relationship ? 
wa quit her job a prerequisit to make amend with nick ? 
throw in the fact that i do n't think nick and kate spent enough time togeth to even warrant that rash of a decis . 
i believ that kate like him , but like him so intens that she wa will to throw her career away ? 
i doubt it . 
and what of the end scene at a wed where the entir congreg feel it necessari to stop everyth and stare at the coupl ? 
are mass group of peopl simultan that interest in total stranger ? 
well , i guess of the congreg consist of movi extra and the stranger are the movi two lead star , then that would make sens .
