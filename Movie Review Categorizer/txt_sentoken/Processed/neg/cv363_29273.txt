susan granger 's review of `` american outlaw `` ( warner bro . ) 
thoma edison 's `` the great train robberi `` ( 1903 ) wa the first western ever made and `` jess jame under the black flag `` ( 1923 ) first introduc the outlaw folk hero . 
now , more than 20 similarly-them pictur later , jess jame and hi notori gang of outlaw ride again in a banal mtv spin on an american legend . 
the stori begin as jess ( charasmat colin farrel ) and hi brother frank ( gabriel macht ) , cole and scott younger ( scott caan , will mccormack ) and trusti comanch tom ( nathaniel arcand ) , after four year of fight for the reb in the civil war , return to liberti , missouri - onli to discov union troop are occupi their hometown . 
and an avarici east coast railroad baron , thaddeu rain ( harri yulin ) , is forc farmer to sell their land at less than true valu , aid by allan pinkerton ( timothi dalton ) and hi infam detect who , back then , were just thug who provid secur . 
but when ma jame ( kathi bate ) becom one of their victim , jess and the rest of the guy ( gregori smith , ty o'neal , joe steven ) form the james-young gang to wreak reveng by attack the railroad 's suppli line , sabotag track and rob the bank where the payrol is kept . 
plu there 's romanc - between jess and a spunki hometown gal , lee mimm ( ali larter ) . 
work from a politically-correct , clich ? -drench , sanit and revisionist screenplay by roderick taylor and john rodger , director le mayfield keep the action fast-pac and goe for lightweight laugh when he can . 
the choppi edit hurt but russel boyd 's cinematographi , luke reichl 's design dud and trevor rabin 's music lend authent . 
on the granger movi gaug of 1 to 10 , `` american outlaw `` is a gallop , formula 3 . 
it 's the wild west re-visit as a date movi .
