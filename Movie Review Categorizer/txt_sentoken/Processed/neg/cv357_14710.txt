what do you get when you rip-off good movi like woodi allen 's banana and martin scorses 's after hour ? 
you 'd think you 'd get the best of both film . 
instead you get woo . 
fall in somewher between def jam 's how to be a player ( which wa aw ) and booti call ( which wa ok ) , woo is yet anoth in the embarass genr of show african-american to be noth more than sexual buffoon . 
the whole film play out as a black version of after hour , as wild woman woo ( jada pinkett smith ) goe out on a blind date with straight-lac tim ( tommi davidson ) . 
mayhem follow them . 
for some unknown reason ( read : contriv screenplay ) davidson put up with all of woo 's antic for the entir night , which includ her destroy hi bathroom mirror , steal thing from hi hous , violent question him ( accus and belittl him actual ) about previou girlfriend , caus a riot in an eleg restaur , and other variou infuri thing that ani normal person would n't toler . 
but for the sake of thi bad movi ? 
sure , whi not ? 
there are a few chuckl in the film , the best be the scene swipe directli from banana . 
in thi case , davidson is run from thug , get into a subway car as the door are close , start to taunt the thug , then the door open back up again . 
a good joke , but a stolen one . 
anoth chuckl is provid by billi dee william ' cameo as himself . 
movi like woo are seemingli releas everi three month or so , and not one of them ha ever been a hit . 
woo wo n't be one either . 
so whi wa it made ? 
and more importantli , is n't there anyon els besid me who think these film are offens ? 
everyon involv should realli reconsid their career at thi point .
