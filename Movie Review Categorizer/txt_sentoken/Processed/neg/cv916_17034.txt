ah , and 1999 wa go along so well , too . 
`` she 's all that `` ha the dubiou distinct of be the worst movi i 've seen so far thi year . 
and quit frankli , i doubt i 'll see anyth equal bad . 
( at least , i * hope * i do n't see anyth equal bad ) . 
`` she 's all that `` tell the stori of the most popular guy in school ( play by freddi prinz jr . ) who accept a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular . 
that , right there , is problem # 1 . 
how mani time have we seen thi storylin ? 
as cook comment near the end of the film , `` it 's kind of like `` pretti woman `` , except without the prostitut `` . 
of cours , had the filmmak attempt to tri someth new with thi materi , the well-worn storylin would have been a devic to propel the movi forward . 
as it is , though , `` she 's all that `` reli * complet * on the lame and overus formula to push it ahead . 
there 's not one origin or interest charact in the film , either , and if that wa n't bad enough , there 's not one good perform featur . 
the star of the movi , rachel leigh cook , is simpli horribl . 
i usual do n't like to get so person , but in thi case , i think it need to be said . 
cook wear the same express throughout the flick and look to be have as miser a time as i wa . 
i wa never convinc that she wa a `` nerd `` , and her transform wa unconvinc and unnecessari . 
the movi seem to be say it 's better to be popular than to be who you are . 
as for freddi prinz jr . , an actor i ordinarili enjoy , he too is quit bad here . 
he coast through the film on so-cal charm , and never establish a real charact . 
kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook . 
and for some indiscern reason , he 's got hear aid . 
no explan is given and they 're never brought up . 
were we suppos to feel * sorri * for him just becaus he wore hear aid ? 
i do n't think so . 
that singl element of the film wa one of the most offens thing i 've seen in a movi in a long time . 
`` she 's all that `` suck . 
that 's what it boil down to . 
it 's not entertain , and it 's not even a good time passer . 
the hour and a half run time goe by slower than a 5 minut hair-remov system informerci . 
and what 's wors , it send out a bad messag to teen . 
it appear to be tell them , `` hey , it doe n't matter if you 're happi the way you are . 
that 's unimport . 
if you want to * truli * be happi , dress in the latest fashion and act like a bubble-head moron . `` 
ugh .
