`` american pie `` alum jason bigg and mena suvari star in thi summer 's attempt to capit on the youth market look for a comedi about young peopl they can relat to that combin gener hollywood cute couple- and zani comedi . 
it 's about an a+ student ( bigg as `` paul `` ) who get a scholarship to some colleg in new york citi who stick out like a sore thumb and fall for dora ( suvari ) a ditzi heroin-ch goth chick who ha no ambit or self-respect whatsoev and allow herself to be push around just like `` hick-boy `` paul is . 
so we 've got a fish-out-wat formula mix with meet-cut romant comedi which ideal should make for a good movi . 
unfortun the atroci screenplay and bore direct by `` clueless `` auteur ami heckerl success manag to screw up everyth about the film . 
these charact are total unrealist and unbeliev - it 's as if everyon under age 30 is a stone raver . 
there 's no background or detail to anyon or anyth , it 's just a bunch of cartoon charact run into each other . 
not to mention the stori itself which is virtual non-exist and contain so mani plothol it 's like swiss chees . 
even the basic edit is bad . 
if you 're look for a romant comedi stay far away from thi one becaus it is neither romant nor funni . 
i saw thi in a pack cinema on open night and the audienc bare laugh at all . 
if you 've seen the commerici you 've seen all the `` funni `` part ( which are all from the first five minut ) .
